For instance, truck manufacturers, <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/truck-accidents\/improper-loading\/\">cargo loaders<\/a> and maintenance companies. All these parties\u2019 insurance companies may owe you compensation.<\/p>\n<h2>What if I lost a family member in a truck accident?<\/h2>\n<p>When a negligent truck driver causes a fatal wreck, the victim&#8217;s estate and their surviving spouse, children and parents may seek compensation. The estate may seek compensation for things like the victim&#8217;s pain and suffering, lost future wages, medical bills and funeral costs. Meanwhile, surviving family members can seek compensation for the loss of companionship and support of the deceased.<\/p>\n<h2>Why do I need a lawyer to represent me?<\/h2>\n<p>Trucking companies have vast resources to fight lawsuits.
