We often take our safety for granted as we use them \u2014 after all, they wouldn&#8217;t make it to market if they weren&#8217;t safe, right?<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, products can fail. And when they don&#8217;t operate as they are supposed to, serious or fatal injuries can result.<\/p>\n<h2>Three Types Of Product Defects<\/h2>\n<p>Product defects fall into one of three categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Design defect \u2014 <\/strong>The defect occurs during the design phase and affects all products.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Manufacturing defect \u2014 <\/strong>The defect occurs during the manufacturing stage and may only affect a small number of units.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Failure to warn \u2014 <\/strong>Some uses of a product may be dangerous and foreseeable. When the user is not warned of that risk, it is a failure to warn defect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>We Help Columbus Residents Obtain Compensation For Their Injuries<\/h2>\n<p>At <span class=\"nap-item nap-item--name\">Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC<\/span>, we are skilled at helping individuals in Columbus, Ohio, recover for injuries caused by defective products.
