For those who survive such an accident, that moment is just the beginning of what can be a long and harrowing ordeal.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Devastating Injuries From Head-On Car Collisions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Head-on collisions can cause devastating injuries. Individuals involved in head-on collisions often suffer:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spinal cord injuries<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/closed-head-injuries\/\">Head trauma<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Broken bones<\/li>\n<li>Chest injuries<\/li>\n<li>Whiplash\/neck injuries<\/li>\n<li>Abdominal injuries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Air bags that are supposed to protect you from injury in a car accident sometimes cause injury, too. Faulty air bags can deploy too forcefully, blowing shrapnel into the cabin of a car and causing severe burns, broken bones and bruises. There have been separate product liability lawsuits in these cases.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>One Reason Why You Need An Experienced Attorney: High Medical Costs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The medical costs required to address these head-on car accident injuries can quickly spiral out of control. If you or a loved one has been injured or <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/fatal-car-accidents\/\">died in a head-on collision<\/a> in Ohio, the effects on your life can be immeasurable.<\/p>\n<p>Due to such long-lasting effects, you should never try to resolve these matters on your own.<\/p>\n<p>An insurance company may give you an offer that sounds tempting, but it is likely less than what you deserve. Don&#8217;t agree to anything until you talk to a personal injury attorney.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Using Over 100 Years Of Combined Experience To Help You Recover Maximum Compensation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>At <span class=\"nap-item nap-item--name\">Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC<\/span>, it&#8217;s our mission to provide committed legal protection when you&#8217;ve been injured by someone else&#8217;s negligence.<\/p>\n<p>Our attorneys have over 100 years of combined experience getting compensation for victims of head-on collisions to pay for medical bills, pain and suffering, property damage, and other expenses that add up after an accident.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes these accidents can prove deadly, leaving loved ones grieving and without income.
