A protracted labor can cause brain injuries and lead to fetal distress due to any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delay in ordering or performing a cesarean section<\/li>\n<li>Misuse of a labor drug such as Pitocin<\/li>\n<li>Intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain)<\/li>\n<li>Imprecise use of a vacuum extractor or forceps<\/li>\n<li>Inadequate resuscitation<\/li>\n<li>Failure of hospital personnel to monitor the newborn after birth<\/li>\n<li>Failure to properly treat infections<\/li>\n<li>Fetal malpresentation\/malposition (including breech)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Premature Births<\/h3>\n<p>Premature birth can lead to serious injuries for your baby. For example, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) are often found in premature infants and cause irreversible brain damage. IVH may be due to <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/birth-injuries\/birth-asphyxia\/\">cerebral hypoxia<\/a>. These injuries can lead to seizures, developmental delays and long-term issues for your baby. Doctors and nurses need to properly monitor these issues to prevent such injuries.<\/p>\n<h2>Shoulder Dystocia And Brachial Plexus Palsy<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/birth-injuries\/shoulder-dystocia\/\">Shoulder dystocia<\/a> and brachial plexus palsy can be the result of medical malpractice during the birthing process. Erb&#8217;s palsy, <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/birth-injuries\/cerebral-palsy\/\">cerebral palsy<\/a>, cerebral hypoxia, muscle injury, loss of the use of an arm, and scarring are just some of the other serious complications.<\/p>\n<p>These injuries are usually related to the compression of nerves as a baby comes down the birth canal. Did the baby get stuck during delivery? Failure of the attending physicians and medical staff to appreciate fetal size and weight can have catastrophic consequences on the delivery.<\/p>\n<h2>When Should I Seek Legal Advice About Birth Injuries?<\/h2>\n<p>Knowing when to take action is important.
