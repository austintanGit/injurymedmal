He or she may hit the vehicle&#8217;s front bumper, the windshield and the ground.<\/li>\n<li>A bicyclist is unprotected, just like a pedestrian, but the bicyclist may also be traveling at a significant speed at the time of a crash. This can further compound injuries.<\/li>\n<li>Injuries are often severe, <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/fatal-car-accidents\/\">catastrophic or fatal<\/a>. Bicyclists frequently suffer head injuries, broken bones, spinal cord injuries and crush injuries (when they are run over).<\/li>\n<li>Hit-and-run bicycle accidents are common.<\/li>\n<li>Even when a motorist is identified, he or she may have little or no insurance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We know how to handle cases with these complicating factors.<\/p>\n<h2>The Expensive Effects Of Bike Accidents<\/h2>\n<p>University students and recreational bicyclists are commonplace in traffic around Columbus. A bike accident injury that interrupts a student&#8217;s semester can be costly in ways that go beyond medical bills. Losing a semester of college can be equivalent to throwing thousands of dollars down the drain.<\/p>\n<p>Working people often lose wages totaling thousands of dollars as they go through therapy and rehabilitation after a bicycle injury. If injuries are severe, returning to work may not be an option. Losing wages may a significant part of your overall losses, along with medical expenses, pain and suffering.<\/p>\n<h2>Schedule A Free Consult Today.
