Inadequate Security<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Was a retailer aware of criminal activity in or near the business and <a href=\"\/other-practice-areas\/premises-liability\/inadequate-security\/\">failed to take adequate security measures<\/a>? Did an apartment complex owner neglect to keep security systems in good repair so that residents and their guests would be protected? If you were injured because of inadequate security, talk to our law firm.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Poor Lighting<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Poor lighting can contribute to inadequate security. It can also make obstructions in parking lots and pathways difficult to see, causing a fall and injury. If the premises manager fails to replace light bulbs in a timely manner or failed to install necessary lighting, you may have a premises liability claim.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Dog Bites And Animal Attacks <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When an owner fails to have an animal under control, that owner is responsible for any injuries the animal causes. A <a href=\"\/other-practice-areas\/premises-liability\/dog-bites\/\">dog bite<\/a> can be physically and psychologically traumatizing. Make sure you have the compensation you need to recover.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Fire Injuries <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Most fires can be prevented through proper installation and maintenance of smoke alarms, fire extinguishers and egress windows. Several individuals can be held accountable for burn injuries and <a href=\"\/other-practice-areas\/premises-liability\/fire-injuries\/\">other fire injuries<\/a>, including property owners, electricians and natural gas suppliers.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Gun Injuries <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/other-practice-areas\/premises-liability\/gun-injuries\/\">Gun owner negligence<\/a> can result in serious injury and death. If you suffered a gunshot wound or if a loved one was killed by gunfire, our attorneys can help you pursue a claim against the negligent gun owner or handler.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Amusement Park Negligence<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>An amusement park is responsible for adequate security, safe rides and safe pathways. If you or a loved one is injured in an amusement park, you could make a claim for damages.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. Inadequate Maintenance Of Common Areas<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Property owners have an obligation to customers, residents and guests. An unsafe elevator, broken stair railing or weak balcony supports can cause grievous injury. You could be entitled to compensation for your injuries.<\/p>\n<h2>Handling Property Injury Cases For 50 Years<\/h2>\n<p>At <span class=\"nap-item nap-item--name\">Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC<\/span>, our firm has a 50-year tradition of representing injured people and their families throughout Ohio and surrounding communities.<\/p>\n<p>If you or a loved one suffered injury on another person&#8217;s property, our lawyers want to hear what happened.
