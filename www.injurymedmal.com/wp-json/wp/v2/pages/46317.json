Overloaded trucks are harder to control and take longer to stop than trucks that are properly loaded. If an item is unsecured and dropped from a trailer, it can become a dangerous missile, crashing into other vehicles or pedestrians.<\/p>\n<h2>Truck Weight And Loading Laws<\/h2>\n<p>According to DOT regulations, truck cargo must be firmly secured. For example, tie-downs must be attached and secured in a manner that prevents the secured item from becoming loose while the truck is in motion. Cargo that is likely to roll must be restrained by chocks, wedges, a cradle or other means.<\/p>\n<p>Each state sets specific limits on how much weight a truck can carry. For example, trucks with three axles have a maximum cargo weight of 48,000 pounds. Trucks with two axles can carry a maximum of 34,000 pounds.<\/p>\n<h2>A Law Firm With Resources To Conduct A Thorough Investigation<\/h2>\n<p>If you or a family member was injured in a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/truck-accidents\/\">trucking accident<\/a>, our attorneys at <span class=\"nap-item nap-item--name\">Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC<\/span>, will take the necessary steps to find out if improper loading was the culprit.<\/p>\n<p>We will review all available evidence, such as the load the truck was carrying, and whether the trucking company has a record of past weight violations.
