Scarring and disfigurement are a reality in many cases &mdash; and can be expensive to treat.<\/p>\n<p>Children, in particular, are often victims of dog bites. Children&#8217;s injuries are particularly heartbreaking &mdash; and can be expensive to deal with in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>Some people hesitate to talk to an attorney when a dog bite involved a dog belonging to a friend, neighbor or family member. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to sue my uncle,&#8221; they tell us, but they could just as easily be talking about a next-door neighbor or brother of a friend.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Children&#8217;s Injuries Require Careful Consideration &mdash; A Lifetime Is A Long Time To Cope With Scarring Caused By A Dog Bite<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>At <span class=\"nap-item nap-item--name\">Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC<\/span>, in Columbus, Ohio, we understand your sentiments.<\/p>\n<p>However, homeowners have insurance and other people often have applicable insurance that can provide the compensation you or your child needs after a dog bite injury. Costs may escalate to the point where you will have no choice but to bring a lawsuit, even when the dog belongs to someone you know.<\/p>\n<p>Before making any decisions, we invite you to reach out to us to talk further about your potential legal options.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Things To Be Aware Of After A Canine Bite Accident<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are several things to keep in mind after you or your child has been injured in an animal attack:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Insurance claim adjusters:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/insurance-disputes\/\">Beware of insurance adjusters<\/a> who may urge you to accept an early settlement before you know the extent of your injuries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Infection:<\/strong> In cases of dog bites, this is a real possibility. Do not accept a settlement until you and your doctor are convinced that this danger has passed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Reconstructive surgery:<\/strong> You or your loved one may need reconstructive surgery in the future. To calculate what a fair settlement is now, your attorney may need to work with physicians and economists who can project what that surgery is likely to cost.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line: Do not accept a settlement offer until you know what lies ahead. Such offers are often lower than what you need or deserve.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Talk To Our Team To Learn More About Your Legal Options<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you or your child was <a href=\"\/other-practice-areas\/premises-liability\/\">attacked and injured<\/a> by a dog or other vicious animal, you need an attorney who is committed to securing fair compensation for you or your loved one.<\/p>\n<p>Contact our team today to schedule an appointment with a lawyer from our office.<\/p>\n<p>Call <strong><span class=\"nap-item nap-item--phone\"><a href=\"tel:+1-614-360-2706\">614-360-2706<\/a><\/span> <\/strong>or <a href=\"\/contact\/\">contact us online<\/a>.
