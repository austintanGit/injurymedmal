Other examples include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>Failure to diagnose cancer:<\/strong> By failing to do an indicated chest X-ray or by misreading a mammogram result, there could be a long delay in treatment &mdash; a delay that is too late to save the patient&#8217;s life or that increases the risk the patient faces.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Misreading and misinterpreting lab tests:<\/strong> If a doctor misreads or <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/x-ray-lab-errors\/\">misinterprets a lab test<\/a>, he or she is negligent. For example, when a lab test indicates an iron overload or excess iron in the blood (possible hemochromatosis) or excess sugar in the blood (possible diabetes), and the doctor fails to diagnose or treat the patient, the patient&#8217;s illness could become worse or even fatal.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Prescription mistakes:<\/strong> Did the physician prescribe the proper medication in the recommended dosage? Were the instructions clear? Prescribing the wrong drug or over-prescribing a drug can be dangerous to the patient.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Misreading an X-ray, CT scan or MRI:<\/strong> By misreading test results, a negligent doctor could fail to treat an illness or treat the wrong illness.
