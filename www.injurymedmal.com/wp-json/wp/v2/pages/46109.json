Examples include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>Failure to diagnose:<\/strong> ERs are busy but healthcare professionals always have an obligation to carefully examine each patient and make a diagnosis. For example, when a fever is dismissed as the flu and the patient dies of meningitis, the failure to diagnose can result in a <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">wrongful death<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Failure to diagnose heart attack:<\/strong> Heart attack symptoms can be misinterpreted as less serious illnesses. A patient who is sent home without appropriate care may suffer another attack that is more damaging or even fatal.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Failure to order tests:<\/strong> Every doctor, no matter how rushed, is expected to meet certain standards of care. If a doctor fails to order an indicated test and that failure results in serious injury or wrongful death, you need the help of an emergency room malpractice lawyer.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Failure to follow up after discharge:<\/strong> Often test results come into the ER after the patient has been discharged. The emergency room has a responsibility to inform the patient about test results &mdash; especially those that indicate a need for further treatment.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Inadequate discharge instructions:<\/strong> Did the emergency room doctor or nurse give instructions about what the patient should do next in terms of medication, wound treatment or seeing another doctor? Failure to do so is <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">medical malpractice<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Misinterpreting tests:<\/strong> If the doctor misinterprets test results, a patient could be discharged by mistake without appropriate care.<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Misreading X-rays:<\/strong> By misreading an X-ray, emergency room professionals may fail to treat a serious medical problem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>50 Years Of Experience<\/h2>\n<p>For 50 years, our law firm has been representing injured people and the families of wrongful death victims all throughout Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>Call our Columbus office at <strong><span class=\"nap-item nap-item--phone\"><a href=\"tel:+1-614-360-2706\">614-360-2706<\/a><\/span><\/strong>, or <a href=\"\/contact\/\">send us an email<\/a><strong> <\/strong>to schedule a free consultation to talk about your situation and options available.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Experienced Legal Representation For Victims Of Emergency Room Errors We depend on emergency rooms to act quickly and appropriately to save lives or lessen the severity of an injury.
