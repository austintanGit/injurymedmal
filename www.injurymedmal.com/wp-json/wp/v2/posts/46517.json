Patients across Ohio will want to know what the researchers found since the trend that was revealed could affect them, too. The study was conducted by a clinical team at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and the two centers in question were at Cedars-Sinai and at UCLA. <\/p>\n<p>In all, 364 patients were evaluated, and 241 were referred for treatment. This was between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. Nineteen of those patients at Cedars-Sinai and 24 at UCLA were found to have been incorrectly diagnosed with MS. In all, about one in five patients were misdiagnosed with the condition. <\/p>\n<p>A major factor in this trend is over-reliance on radiographic findings, and their misinterpretation, whenever patients display symptoms that fall outside <a href=\"https:\/\/multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com\/2019\/02\/13\/almost-1-in-5-people-wrongly-diagnosed-with-ms-at-two-specialized-centers-in-us-study-finds\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MS diagnostic criteria<\/a>. For example, 74 percent of all the Cedars-Sinai patients and 67 percent of the UCLA group suffered from headaches and other symptoms uncharacteristic of MS. <\/p>\n<p>Of the misdiagnosed patients, 72 percent were prescribed disease-modifying MS treatments. Another 48 percent were also prescribed a certain procedure known to increase the risk for a serious viral brain infection. To date, there is no single test to identify MS, and MS-mimicking conditions are numerous. <\/p>\n<p>Unnecessary MS disease-modifying treatments cost the U.S. health care industry an estimated $10 million. Patients who have been misdiagnosed and burdened with these costs may be able to file a malpractice claim. A valid claim should prove that <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">medical negligence<\/a> was behind the misdiagnosis. This means the doctor must be shown to have neglected generally accepted medical practices. A lawyer may be helpful in filing the claim and gathering proof. A victim could leave all negotiations for a settlement to their lawyer. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A recently published study has found that the misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis is not uncommon at two MS-specializing centers.
