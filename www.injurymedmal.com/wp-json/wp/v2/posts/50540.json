Unfortunately, incidents such as this happen every day in Ohio. Most Ohioans carry auto insurance policies that will compensate them financially should they be involved in a car crash, and in fact Ohio law requires motorists to have a certain amount of auto insurance coverage. However, how much coverage do you really need?<\/p>\n<h2>Minimum coverage<\/h2>\n<p>In Ohio, the minimum car insurance coverage is generally the most expensive. Under <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmv.ohio.gov\/dl-mandatory-insurance.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ohio law<\/a>, motorists must carry at least $25,000 in insurance coverage for injury\/death of one person, $50,000 for injury\/death of two or more individuals and $25,000 for property damage in the event of a crash. Carrying the minimum amount of insurance can be costly for motorists and may discourage them from carrying more than the minimal coverage. However, carrying further protection may not be as costly as carrying the minimal protection.<\/p>\n<h2>Carrying further coverage<\/h2>\n<p>While the minimum amount of insurance coverage can be costly, carrying a further $250,000 in insurance coverage may wind up being less costly in the end. If you are in an motor vehicle accident that results in injuries or significant property damage, the costs could go above and beyond the minimum insurance requirements and you could face a lawsuit for the costs that are left. If you carry enough <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/car-insurance\/state\/best-cheap-car-insurance-ohio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance coverage<\/a> you may avoid the possibility of a lawsuit that could cause you to incur a significant amount of expenses. The extra coverage you may want to consider includes uninsured\/underinsured motorist coverage, medical payments and collision and comprehensive coverage.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn more about your options if you are in a car crash<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you carry the minimum amount of insurance coverage or a greater amount of insurance coverage, if you are involved in a serious car crash you may find that your damages exceed what is covered by your insurance. If this is the case, you may want to consider filing a lawsuit against the party responsible for the crash. This post is for educational purposes only and does not contain legal advice.
