Losing a loved one is difficult enough, but when the unexpected loss is caused by another&#8217;s negligence, the family may not only need emotional support but also legal support. When someone else&#8217;s lack of care causes a death, the family and loved ones of the deceased may be able to recover compensation through a <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">wrongful death<\/a> lawsuit.<\/p>\n<p>An Ohio woman is suing the manufacturer of a prescription drug called Pradaxa for the wrongful death of her husband. Pradaxa is a blood thinner that is administered to patients that are experiencing atrial fibrillation to prevent them from experiencing a stroke. The woman&#8217;s husband started taking the medication in June 2011. In February 2012, he experienced severe internal bleeding and was admitted to the hospital, where he later died from the bleeding.<\/p>\n<p>The woman is claiming that her husband was the victim of a wrongful death because the manufacturer knew of the drug&#8217;s potential to cause internal bleeding, that there was no antidote for it and that they did not properly warn patients of the risks.<\/p>\n<p>After experiencing the sudden death of a loved one, seeking out information about legal options may be the last thing on the family&#8217;s mind. However, recovering compensation from a wrongful death lawsuit can help immensely in the wake of the financial obligations that arise after a death. The family may find themselves facing medical bills, death expenses, lost wages and other expenses. Although a successful wrongful death lawsuit will not bring back a loved one, it will help the survivors work through the tough financial situation that this type of situation will likely put them in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source: <\/strong>Injury Lawyer News, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/injurylawyer-news.com\/2012\/11\/pradaxa-lawsuit-alleges-wrongful-death-and-inadequate-warning-label\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pradaxa Lawsuit Alleges Wrongful Death and Inadequate Warning Label<\/a>,&#8221; Perry Larkin, Nov. 9, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When someone unexpectedly loses a loved one, they almost always need emotional support to work through what can be a very difficult time.
