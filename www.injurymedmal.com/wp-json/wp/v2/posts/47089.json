That suggests they&#8217;re addicted, even if they&#8217;re not willing to admit it.<\/p>\n<p>Another 28 percent also hinted at this addiction by saying they were just concerned that not reading a text instantly meant they&#8217;d miss out on something. Despite the fact that the majority of text messages are not urgent, they worried about it with every text.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have been in accidents seem to have a better grasp on the reality, as one young man spent time speaking up against texting and driving after causing a deadly crash.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have not yet crashed, though, seem more than willing to take the risk.
