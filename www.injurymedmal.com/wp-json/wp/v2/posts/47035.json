Although McGregor had told his fans he intended to win his &#8216;money match,&#8217; it ended up with his 10th round knockout of the technical variety instead.<\/p>\n<p>Soon after the match was prematurely terminated, media outlets began questioning the veteran referee that had been hired to work the match. They wondered if he&#8217;d exercised sound judgement in ending the match when he did.<\/p>\n<p>He noted that, when he decided to end the match, it was clear that the UFC fighter already looked physically battered. He also said that he appeared to be unstable on his feet.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, the referee thought that McGregor wasn&#8217;t accustomed to spending 30 minutes as he just had in the ring getting bruised and battered. He thought that McGregor was simply very fatigued. Within moments though, a ringside physician who evaluated the famed fighter determined he was suffering traumatic brain injury symptoms instead.<\/p>\n<p>That ringside physician has since praised the referee for knowing when to pull the plug on the match. Seemingly, under further evaluation, he determined that the UFC fighter was suffering from ataxia, a condition which leaves afflicted individuals with poor balance or dizziness. This is one of the telltale signs of a concussion.<\/p>\n<p>The doctor said that had the referee not stopped the match when he did, he would have been grossly negligent.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve suffered a brain injury as the result of someone else&#8217;s negligence, then you may benefit from discussing your case with a Columbus, Ohio personal injury attorney. In doing so, he or she can advise you of potential legal remedies available to you to cover medical expenses associated with your injury.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> mmamania.com, &#8220;Doctor: Conor McGregor suffered mild traumatic brain injury in TKO loss to Floyd Mayweather,&#8221; Jesse Holland, Sep. 01, 2017<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The match between famed boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and the United Fighting Championship (UFC) champion Conor McGregor on Saturday, August 26th was highly anticipated.
