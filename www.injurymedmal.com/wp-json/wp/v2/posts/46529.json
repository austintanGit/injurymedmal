Some of these unsafe factors make a major difference in the likelihood that you&#8217;re going to get home safely when traveling.<\/p>\n<p>Although it may not seem like it, simple things like rain or darkness can make traffic much more dangerous. The good news is that you can recognize these unsafe driving factors and avoid making mistakes that result in injuries.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States, according to 2015 statistics. There has been a 19-percent decrease in the number of crashes in the last decade, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that drivers can afford to relax. Some of the following are causes of crashes that you should watch out for.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Traffic jams<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Traffic jams are one cause of collisions on highways. These jams are difficult for drivers, because they&#8217;re slowed down, stopping and accelerating at random times. It&#8217;s hard to predict the flow of traffic, so everyone has to pay close attention. Failing to do so due to distractions or other causes can result in rear-end crashes, which then continue to increase the amount of backed up traffic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Poor skills<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When there are many people on the roads with weak driving skills, there&#8217;s a higher risk of a crash taking place. For example, if you&#8217;re driving near a high school, it&#8217;s possible that you&#8217;ll be surrounded by new drivers. These drivers don&#8217;t have much experience, which puts them at a higher likelihood of making mistakes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Drowsiness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Another hazard is drowsiness. When a driver is drowsy, they aren&#8217;t paying attention in the way that they should. They may be fighting to stay awake or not notice that they&#8217;re falling asleep during a drive. Even nodding off for a few seconds is enough to lead to a serious collision with another driver.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Construction work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finally, there is construction work. Construction work is dangerous for a few reasons. The roads might be uneven, arranged differently than usual or there may be objects in or near the roadway. Drivers who are approaching construction zones should take the time to slow down and avoid colliding with any person or item that is there. It may take longer to get through the zone, but it&#8217;s worth protecting people&#8217;s lives.<\/p>\n<p>These are a few reasons for auto accidents. Take your time, so you can reduce the chance of being involved in one yourself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Traffic accidents are caused by a number of factors.
