When first responders were called to the scene around 1:15 a.m. on April 30, they found the man pinned between a wall and metal ramp. At the time of the report, the accident was being investigated by local and state officials, including the Hamilton County Coroner&#8217;s office. Authorities also notified the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. <\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the company said that they were conducting their own investigation and would not be able to comment further on the incident until the investigation is complete. She said that their thoughts and prayers go out to the man&#8217;s family. <\/p>\n<p>Details of the accident were vague at the time of the police report, and reports did not indicate how the man got pinned or if he was alone when the accident happened. Many industries have operating procedures designed to prevent such accidents, and work performed in warehouses and loading areas is also governed by OSHA regulations. <\/p>\n<p>When a <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">fatal accident<\/a> occurs, it is sometimes possible for the family of the victim to file a wrongful death lawsuit and seek compensation for loss of companionship, loss of financial support and final expenses, especially if the cause of the accident can be attributed to negligence. Anyone facing such circumstances may want to discuss their situation with an attorney who could investigate the accident and help them decide on their best course of action going forward. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>MLive, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mlive.com\/business\/west-michigan\/index.ssf\/2014\/04\/report_death_of_ohio_truck_dri.html\" target=\"_blank\">Report: Death of Ohio truck driver at SpartanNash facility under investigation<\/a>&#8220;, Shandra Martinez, April 30, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An accident that occurred in a loading area of a southwest Ohio food distribution and retail company has taken the life of a 65-year-old truck driver from Lima.
