In addition to considering the conduct of doctors, nurses and other individuals, there are entities to consider if a malpractice claim is being filed. <\/p>\n<p>A hospital may be held responsible for <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">medical malpractice<\/a> situations based on institutional negligence. Additionally, vicarious liability is possible if the employee of such a company is negligent. The matter may depend on the relationship between those providing services in the institution since a direct employee of the company should have been properly evaluated for professional qualifications prior to being hired. Similarly, granting privileges to a physician as an independent contractor should include an evaluation of that individual&#8217;s credentials. <\/p>\n<p>Pharmaceutical companies might be held liable in cases involving patient injuries, particularly if physicians have not been advised of possible adverse effects. A pharmaceutical manufacturer is to provide appropriate information to physicians and to safely manufacture products. If the pharmaceutical company has withheld information or created a product with errors or unsafe practices, the manufacturer might be sued for medical malpractice. If a <a href=\"http:\/\/injury.findlaw.com\/medical-malpractice\/medical-malpractice-who-can-be-sued-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drug-related injury<\/a> has occurred because of a physician or pharmacy error, however, then the individual or company in error might be sued. <\/p>\n<p>An individual who is dealing with the repercussions of a medical error may wonder whether a malpractice suit is warranted. It may be helpful to meet with a lawyer to discuss the error and the resulting complications and losses to determine whether action is warranted. The lawyer may assist with investigating related records and filing the appropriate paperwork. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>findlaw.com, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/injury.findlaw.com\/medical-malpractice\/medical-malpractice-who-can-be-sued-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medical Malpractice: Who Can Be Sued?<\/a>&#8220;, September 06, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are many individuals involved in medical care, which can make it difficult for an Ohio resident to identify a liable party in the event of a possible medical malpractice incident.
