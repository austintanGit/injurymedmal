If not, you should think about that. Some of the medical innovations that occur come with new or improved equipment. If your doctor doesn&#8217;t have access to the necessary equipment, you might not get the care you need.<\/p>\n<p>It is often difficult to determine if the equipment your doctor is using is outdated. In some cases, it can be impossible because you aren&#8217;t an expert in the field. You probably don&#8217;t know what you are looking for when you are trying to determine if the equipment is up-to-date. Instead, you rely on your doctor&#8217;s expertise.<\/p>\n<p>If you are injured by medical malpractice, a look at the equipment that the doctor used might be in order. Doctors owe you a duty of care, and when that duty is breached, you might have a claim for compensation.<\/p>\n<p>How the medical equipment can come into the picture is determined by your specific case. Faulty or outdated equipment that can lead to <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">patient harm<\/a> might be the basis of a medical negligence claim.<\/p>\n<p>An example of how faulty equipment might lead to harm occurred when a faulty ultrasound machine failed to pick up a baby&#8217;s heartbeat. Doctors allowed the woman to labor on thinking that the baby was dead. The baby wasn&#8217;t dead, but was born with brain damage because of the delay. For a decade, the hospital hadn&#8217;t done maintenance on the machine. A successful claim for compensation was made in the amount of $78 million.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you consider all possible causes when you file a medical malpractice claim. This can have a big impact on your case.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> FindLaw, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.findlaw.com\/injured\/2016\/07\/medical-malpractice-for-doctors-use-of-outdated-medical-equipment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medical Malpractice for Doctor&#8217;s Use of Outdated Medical Equipment<\/a>,&#8221; Ephrat Livni, Esq., accessed July 26, 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever thought about how the equipment your doctor uses can affect your medical care?
