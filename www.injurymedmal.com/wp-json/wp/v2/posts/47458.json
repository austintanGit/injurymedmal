A strong emotional response to an auto accident is normal. In some cases, however, post-traumatic stress may develop, causing additional complications that can limit or stall the victim&#8217;s full recovery. <\/p>\n<p>Post-traumatic stress is a mental health condition that can significantly impact the victim&#8217;s ability to behave and function productively in everyday life. Overwhelming feelings of anxiety and fear can interfere with the victim&#8217;s general well-being and contribute to the ongoing pain and suffering often experienced following a serious injury. For example, the development of the debilitating fear that another accident could occur might keep the victim from getting into a vehicle or worrying while family and friends are unreachable when out of the house. <\/p>\n<p>The aftermath of a drunk driving accident, hit-and-run or head-on collision may involve the stresses associated with the accident investigation, medical care, insurance companies and <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">financial concerns<\/a> related to an inability to return to work. If post-traumatic stress develops, the victim may find driving, recovery and thoughts of the accident overwhelming. In some cases, medical intervention is necessary to manage the condition. <\/p>\n<p>If the actions of a negligent driver, such as driving and texting, caused an accident that resulted in a serious injury, an attorney might be able to evaluate the details of the case to determine if the victim may be entitled to any compensation. Attorneys may explain the general legal process and protect the victim&#8217;s rights in the event that the accident was due to another party&#8217;s negligence. Accidents can be traumatic, but a qualified legal team could help manage the aftermath. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Familydoctor.org, <a href=\"http:\/\/familydoctor.org\/familydoctor\/en\/diseases-conditions\/post-traumatic-stress-disorder\/causes-risk-factors\/post-traumatic-stress-after-a-traffic-accident.html\" target=\"_blank\">&#8221; Post-traumatic Stress After a Traffic Accident,&#8221;<\/a> Accessed on Jan. 18, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many times, the effects of being involved in a car accident can go beyond physical injuries and accumulating medical expenses.
