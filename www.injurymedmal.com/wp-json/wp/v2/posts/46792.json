There were 5.7 million such crashes in 2013 and 6.4 million in 2017 &#8212; a 12.3 percent increase. In that same period, the number of mobile workers with smartphones jumped from 55 to 77 percent. The vehicle management and reimbursement platform Motus has connected the two trends in its 2018 Distracted Driving Report. <\/p>\n<p>The report goes on to say that every year, mobile workers drive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20180920005122\/en\/Car-Accidents-Increase-12.3-Percent-Rise-Always-Connected\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1,200 distracted miles<\/a>. With mobile workers becoming increasingly connected at all times, it&#8217;s clear that phone use is a factor in these numbers. It should also be kept in mind that mobile workers on average take 49 percent more trips than any other type of employee in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Motus found that smartphone use was prominent not only during the morning and evening (during mobile workers&#8217; commutes) but also between the hours of 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Smartphone use affects everyone. In 2017, Americans drove 107 billion miles while distracted by their phones. <\/p>\n<p>With training modules, motor vehicle record checks, insurance verification and other tools, Motus says it has been able to help businesses reduce collision rates among mobile workers by an average of 35 percent. However, many employers neglect to hold their grey fleet drivers to a high standard. This could be considered negligence. <\/p>\n<p>Someone who incurs <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">auto accident injuries<\/a> because of another&#8217;s negligence can see a lawyer about filing a claim. In Ohio, the statute of limitations is two years following the accident. A lawyer could help a victim by gathering evidence and negotiating for a settlement with the other side. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Ohio and across the U.S., the number of car crashes among mobile workers is on the rise.
