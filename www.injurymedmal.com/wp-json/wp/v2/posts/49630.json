Accident victims may be surprised to learn there is a limit on the amount of money that a victim can receive for compensation for damages. This limit is known as a \u201cdamage cap.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ohio law limits the compensation someone can receive from an accident. In this post, we will look at how much those limits are.<\/p>\n<h2>What exactly is a damage cap?<\/h2>\n<p>A damage cap is a law that places a maximum payout on a claim for personal injury. Ohio law says a victim&#8217;s damages &#8220;shall not exceed the greater of $250,000 or an amount that is equal to three times the economic loss.&#8221; Economic loss usually consists of medical bills and lost wages from missing employment due to being injured.<\/p>\n<p>Non-economic damages cannot be more than $350,000 for an individual. Non-economic damages are more commonly referred to as compensation for \u201cpain and suffering.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are exceptions, however. State law in Ohio says the noneconomic cap does not apply to compensation if someone has sustained an injury which includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Permanent and substantial physical deformity, loss of use of a limb, or loss of a bodily organ system, or<\/li>\n<li>Permanent physical functional injury that permanently prevents the injured person from being able to independently care for self and perform life-sustaining activities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When determining this dollar amount, the law says courts cannot consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evidence of a defendant&#8217;s alleged wrongdoing, misconduct, or guilt<\/li>\n<li>Evidence of a defendant&#8217;s wealth or financial resources<\/li>\n<li>Evidence that is offered for the purpose of punishing the defendant<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The current Ohio law went into effect in 2005.<\/p>\n<h2>Do you have questions?<\/h2>\n<p>If you have questions about this issue, contact an experienced Ohio personal injury attorney.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After an accident that causes a personal injury, victims may want to make a claim against the at-fault party.
