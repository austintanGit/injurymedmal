The accident occurred shortly after 10 p.m. and involved a drunk driver. A 57-year-old woman had stopped her car at a traffic light when her vehicle was impacted by a Land Rover driven by an alleged drunk driver in her mid-30s. The 57-year-old woman sustained numerous injuries including a partially collapsed lung, rib fractures and a skull fracture.<\/p>\n<p>She was taken to a local hospital for treatment. The drunk driver was arrested and charged with aggravated vehicular assault.<\/p>\n<p>After experiencing a skull fracture, the victim is not the only one subjected to additional hardships. These hardships will be felt by the family as well, and will likely have a lasting impact. In a situation like this one, where there is obviously a negligent party, such as a drunk driver who caused the accident, the victim and the family may be able to recover compensation through a personal injury lawsuit.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has become a victim of a negligent or careless driver and has sustained injuries should receive the compensation to which they are entitled. In addition, negligent parties should be held accountable for their actions and pay the damages that are due.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source: <\/strong>Cuyahoga Falls Patch, &#8220;Police: Drunken Driver Slams Into Car, Woman&#8217;s Skull Fractured,&#8221; John Deike, Nov. 15, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accidents that involve reckless drivers occur daily.
