This can involve a variety of different circumstances. It can mean operating on the correct part of the body, but at the wrong location. An example of this would be if a surgeon operated on your spine, but the operation was done at the wrong level of the spine.<\/p>\n<p>It is also possible for the <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/surgical-errors\/\">wrong-site surgery<\/a> to occur on an incorrect body part. An example of this would be if the right arm needs surgery but the left leg is operated on. It is even possible for a wrong-site surgery to be done on the wrong patient. An example of this would be if Patient A was supposed to have heart surgery, but it was performed on Patient B instead. This usually occurs when patients have similar last names.<\/p>\n<p>Patients can take certain steps to reduce the likelihood of a surgical error. One way to do this is to ask questions about what is being done, what risks are present and what medications you will receive. After the surgery, you can ask questions about the surgical procedure. Because you might be affected by the anesthesia, you should <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jointcommission.org\/assets\/1\/18\/wrong_site_brochure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bring someone with you<\/a> who can act as your advocate.<\/p>\n<p>If you were harmed because of a surgical error, you might choose to seek compensation.
