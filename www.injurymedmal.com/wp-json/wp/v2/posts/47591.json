The <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a> occurred after one of the drivers lost control of her car.<\/p>\n<p>The crash happened at about 6:50 a.m. in Norwalk. A 37-year-old woman in a Honda Civic was traveling northbound on Whittlesey Avenue when she lost control of her car near the intersection with Lais Road. The Civic then crossed into opposing traffic and collided head-on with a Dodge Nitro carrying three people. Both vehicles came to a stop on the side of the road. Police are still investigating the crash.<\/p>\n<p>Paramedics pronounced the 37-year-old woman dead at the scene of the accident. An EMS crew took her body to a Norwalk funeral home directly from the crash site. Ambulance crews took two people in the Dodge Nitro, a 39-year-old female driver and her teenage passenger, to Fisher Titus Medical Center for treatment of major injuries. The third passenger, also a teenager, suffered non-incapacitating injuries.<\/p>\n<p>People who are injured in auto accidents may suffer injuries that permanently disable them or that require long-term medical care, which may leave them with expensive medical bills resulting from treatments of their injuries. Car accident victims may be able to seek compensation from that driver&#8217;s estate if the liable driver dies in the crash. Victims could consult with an attorney to explore their options for filing personal injury suits. They could be reimbursed for medical care expenses, lost wages and the costs for repairing a damaged vehicle.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Source:<\/strong> Norwalk Reflector, &#8220;Norwalk woman killed in crash,&#8221; Norwalk Reflector Staff, April 15, 2014<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:\u00a0<\/b>Sandusky Register, &#8220;Crash kills Norwalk woman&#8221;, April 16, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to a report, an Ohio accident resulted in injuries to three people and the death of one woman on April 15.
