According to the Ohio State Highway Patrol, the accident occurred on Dec. 7 near mile marker four on State Route 257.<\/p>\n<p>The child&#8217;s mother and father were in the vehicle traveling southbound on Route 257 when a vehicle headed northbound crossed over the center line, striking the vehicle with the 4-year-old inside. The little girl&#8217;s parents were taken to Riverside Methodist Hospital. Their conditions were listed as critical. The 4-year-old was taken to Dublin Methodist Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.<\/p>\n<p>The driver of the other vehicle was listed in critical condition when he was taken to Grant Medical Center. There have not been any charges filed. However, the accident is still under investigation.<\/p>\n<p>When a car accident claims the life of a loved one, it is truly tragic. While no amount of money can ever replace a loved one&#8217;s life, <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/\">seeking compensation<\/a> for medical expenses, final expenses, pain and suffering and loss of companionship can help to ease the financial burden that often appears.<\/p>\n<p>A negligent driver&#8217;s insurance company will likely contact any injured parties from an accident. It&#8217;s not always wise to try to speak with the insurance company agents. They are not interested in helping you or making things easy for you. The only thing they care about is paying out as little as possible on a claim.<\/p>\n<p>If you sign paperwork agreeing to a settlement, you cannot go back later and say that you want a larger settlement. Be sure to speak with your attorney before you deal with an insurance agent on an accident claim.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> NBC 4i, &#8220;4-year-old child killed in Delaware County Crash,&#8221; Dec. 07, 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Concord Township, Ohio, a traffic accident has claimed the life of a 4-year-old girl.
