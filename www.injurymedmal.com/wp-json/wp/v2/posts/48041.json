Officers from the Ohio Highway Patrol stated that a 45-year-old male driver from Ottawa caused the <a title=\"accident\" href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\" target=\"_blank\">accident<\/a> when he was headed northbound on County Road 14 and crossed into the path of oncoming traffic. His pickup truck subsequently collided head on with the woman&#8217;s vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Emergency personnel transported the man to Putnam County Ambulatory Care Center where he refused treatment. Sadly, the young woman succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced dead on the scene. Police arrested the at-fault driver and charged him with vehicular homicide.<\/p>\n<p>Troopers reportedly believe the gentleman had been drinking at the time of the crash. He refused to submit to a breathalyzer test, but was given a blood test after officers obtained a warrant to do so.<\/p>\n<p>The young woman&#8217;s family is undoubtedly devastated by their tragic loss. Not only will they be forced to face their grief, but they will also be required to make her final preparations and handle any outstanding business the young lady may have left behind. Given the circumstances behind the crash, it is highly likely that the family could seek reparation in the form of a personal injury claim. The family may be entitled to compensation that could help cover funeral costs, outstanding medical debt and even lost wages.<\/p>\n<p>Legal representatives in the Columbus area may be able to provide information and advice if the woman&#8217;s loved ones decide to pursue damages in conjunction with a fatal car accident.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Toledo Blade, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.toledoblade.com\/local\/2011\/07\/13\/Woman-killed-in-two-car-accident-in-Putnam-County.html\" target=\"_blank\">Woman killed in two-car accident in Putnam County<\/a>,&#8221; July 13, 2011<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A 21-year-old Ohio woman from Columbus Grove tragically lost her life in a motor vehicle accident that took place last month.
