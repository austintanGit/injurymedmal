The longer that people live, the less likely they are to remain active in their community. This means that they aren&#8217;t a visible presence.<\/p>\n<p>That makes it harder for people to know when abuse and neglect are happening, especially if they&#8217;re living with supposedly loving family members who are more interested in the senior&#8217;s Social Security benefits or pension than they are in that person&#8217;s health and well-being.<\/p>\n<p>Even social service agencies can have a hard time stopping abuse. First, someone has to alert them that there is a problem &#8212; a big hurdle because family members often are afraid that they&#8217;ll be found out if they tell and face retaliation. Second, these agencies have to find the senior.<\/p>\n<p>Take the case of the 78-year-old man who couldn&#8217;t bathe himself or take his own medication. To keep social services from putting the former pastor in a home (which would have meant an end to any income provided by the elderly man&#8217;s benefits), his grandson hid him from caseworkers at a private nursing home, a hotel and then in an empty apartment. When caseworkers finally found the man, he was sitting alone in a room without a bed, food or supervision.<\/p>\n<p>One of the problems that has faced caseworkers is that many work for different agencies with similar goals, but they weren&#8217;t able to share information with each other easily.<\/p>\n<p>Ohio is taking steps to change that. The creation of interdisciplinary teams, or I-Teams, makes it easier for the various agencies to combine their efforts and manpower when dealing with a difficult case of suspected abuse or neglect.<\/p>\n<p>While social service organizations like the Agency on Aging and the Job and Family Services Department (which overseas the Medicaid program many senior are on) are already working together, I-Teams would like to see help from area hospitals, the coroner&#8217;s office, local prosecutor&#8217;s, probate courts and local banks &#8212; all of whom may know information that could help.<\/p>\n<p>Elder neglect and abuse is a national problem that can happen whether the senior is at home with a relative or in a supposedly safe environment like a nursing home.
