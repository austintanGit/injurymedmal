Four Ohio State students recently did just that, as they loaded into a car and set out south to Florida. Sadly, after enjoying their vacation, the young women were involved in a tragic <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">car accident<\/a> that left two people dead and six severely injured.<\/p>\n<p>The fatal car accident occurred as the four women were traveling home on a Florida highway.
