The accident occurred around noon. The minivan was traveling north along the highway when the vehicle was struck by a semi. The semi then kept moving and dragged the minivan onto the ramp to Route 15. The semi did not stop at any point.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities are currently in search of the semi that caused this accident. The driver of the minivan was transported to the hospital to be treated for her injuries. She is currently listed in serious condition.<\/p>\n<p>In a truck accident, also known as a semi accident, it is always important for the injured party to understand their rights. Due to the nature of interstate commerce regulations, as well as the additional legislation that applies to drivers of commercial motor vehicles, these cases can quickly become very complicated.<\/p>\n<p>There are many more avenues that need to be analyzed and addressed in a truck accident than in an accident involving only passenger vehicles.
