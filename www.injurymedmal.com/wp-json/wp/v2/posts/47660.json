However, one California woman says that the hospital that she went to because of severe abdominal pain was negligent. A medical resident discharged the woman, who was 39 weeks pregnant and living in a homeless shelter with two other children. She returned to the hospital 12 hours later in order to deliver her baby boy via emergency C-section. <\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/motorcycle-accidents\/\">medical malpractice<\/a> lawsuit was filed on behalf of the woman&#8217;s child, who is now 18 months old. The suit claims that the toddler suffered a brain injury after getting insufficient oxygen when his mother suffered a ruptured uterus. According to the lawsuit, the woman did not see any of the attending obstetricians during the 14 hours she spent at the hospital&#8217;s labor and delivery unit. The woman&#8217;s attorney said that the hospital was anxious to release her because it did not take the extent of her pain seriously. <\/p>\n<p>The hospital agreed to pay a $7.5 settlement to the toddler. As a result of the settlement, the woman&#8217;s case will be reported to the California medical board. The settlement includes more than $300,000 allocated for the child&#8217;s medical costs. This settlement is one of the largest approved in Los Angeles county in eight years.<\/p>\n<p>The toddler needs round-the-clock care and was living in a facility away from his family. His mother would take a two-hour bus ride to visit him. Now, part of the settlement will go towards buying a home and providing him with medical care so he can live with his family. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>Insurance Journal, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.insurancejournal.com\/news\/west\/2013\/11\/07\/310612.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Los Angeles County Settles $7.5M Medical Malpractice Suit<\/a>&#8220;, November 07, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Expectant mothers in Ohio concerned about the health of their unborn children hope to get the best medical care during an emergency.
