One former college football player has decided to pursue a medical malpractice claim against the University of California regents. The former player claims that he suffered multiple concussions while he played for the university from 2004 to 2008. The lawsuit says that he is suffering from lasting effects of the concussions.<\/p>\n<p>Besides the regents, the former head coach, head athletic trainer and team physician have also been named in the lawsuit. The issue brought up by the lawsuit is that the school should have educated players about the neurological diseases that can affect players long after the head injuries.<\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit against the university claims that the former player suffered from memory loss, suicidal thoughts, depression, memory loss, double vision and blurred vision that was caused by the repeated concussions he suffered while playing for the Golden Bears. The former player&#8217;s attorney claims that he wouldn&#8217;t have played or would have taken more time for recovery after the injuries if he had known about the risks.<\/p>\n<p>As time progresses, improvements are made in the design of helmets to help decrease the risk of head injuries. While these improvements are a step in the right direction, they aren&#8217;t foolproof. Athletes can still suffer head injuries and should be warned of those dangers. Ohio athletes might enjoy following this case to see what happens.<\/p>\n<p>If you have suffered a head injury, or repeated head injuries, you might opt to seek compensation for those injuries. Learning how to do so and deciding who should be held accountable for your injuries are necessary steps in the process.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> The Los Angeles Times, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/sports\/sportsnow\/la-sp-sn-cal-football-medical-malpractice-20150814-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Former California football player sues university for medical malpractice over head injuries<\/a>,&#8221; Chuck Schilken, Aug. 14, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The connection between contact sports, such as football, and head injuries is something that is now widely known.
