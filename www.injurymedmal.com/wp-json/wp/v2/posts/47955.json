The man who was injured in the <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/truck-accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">truck accident<\/a> was taken to a local hospital but was later transported by helicopter to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. Reportedly, the elderly man was still in the hospital&#8217;s intensive care unit on Wednesday, but he was said to be in stable condition.<\/p>\n<p>The 52-year-old semi driver, also from Ohio, faces a preliminary charge of driving while intoxicated causing serious bodily injury, which is a Class D felony charge that typically carries an 18-month prison sentence upon conviction. The man&#8217;s semi was pulling a grain trailer when it slammed into the pickup truck shortly after noon on Jan. 10. Witnesses of the accident said that the semi truck barreled into the intersection despite having a red-light signal. Police investigators said that there was no indication that the semi driver applied his breaks or tried to avoid a collision before crashing into the pickup.<\/p>\n<p>Reportedly, a blood test administered by police indicated that the 52-year-old semi driver had traces of methamphetamine and marijuana in his blood when the accident occurred. A tube with meth in it was found in the semi driver&#8217;s shirt pocket, and in a nearby field, police located a plastic bag and a pipe which both contained marijuana. Additionally, police found in a nearby church parking lot a plastic container with more meth in it, plus a single Oxycontin pill was located in the glove compartment of the semi. A witness claims he saw the truck driver walking in a field and tossing away items just after the accident.<\/p>\n<p>The semi driver, who is currently being held in a county jail, is likely to be charged with drug crimes. He may also expect to face a personal injury claim for the apparently reckless and negligent behavior that resulted in the 82-year-old&#8217;s serious injuries.<\/p>\n<p>Source: thestarpress.com, &#8220;Semi driver arrested after traffic accident in Winchester,&#8221; Douglas Walker, Jan. 11, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An 82-year-old Ohio man was seriously injured after a semi truck driver, who had apparently ingested methamphetamine and marijuana, ran a red light and crashed his vehicle into the 82-year-old&#8217;s pickup.
