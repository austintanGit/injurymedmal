In 2013, the National Football League settled with many current and former players for concussion-related injuries, and there are other professional sports leagues that are seeing lawsuits.<\/p>\n<p>Many players have been diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is a degenerative disease that is caused by repeated injuries to the brain. The disease can only be diagnosed after the player has passed away. The disease causes migraines, memory loss, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, paranoia, aggression and progressive dementia.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17712817\" target=\"_blank\">studies<\/a> reported by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, cannabis can reduce damage caused by brain injuries, and it can helps athletes manage the symptoms of CTE. One physician says, &#8220;Cannabis could be potentially beneficial to all sports, but especially those with high risk for head injury because it can likely protect participants from the long-term consequences of concussion and trauma.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The part of cannabis that is non-psychoactive &#8212; CBD &#8212; has the potential to treat concussions, but it also has the potential to prevent these disabling brain injuries. Several players have lobbied the NFL to use medical cannabis as a treatment for concussions, but currently, to no avail.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/traumatic-brain-injuries\/\">treatment for concussions<\/a> and other traumatic brain injuries has come a long way, there is certainly a long way to go. If you or a loved one has suffered a traumatic brain injury because of someone else&#8217;s negligence, you may wish to seek compensation for your medical bills, lost wages and more.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> weednews.co, &#8220;Cannabis Is Sports Medicine: Concussions, CTE And Traumatic Brain Injury,&#8221; Jason Barker, Dec. 20, 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There has been a lot in the news lately about brain injuries and their relationship to playing both professional and amateur sports.
