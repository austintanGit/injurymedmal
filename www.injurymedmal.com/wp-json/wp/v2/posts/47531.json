Three other people were also seriously injured in the wreck. <\/p>\n<p>According to police, a 26-year-old male driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee was traveling southbound on an Ohio road when he crossed into northbound traffic. The driver collided head-on with a Plymouth Acclaim driven by a 16-year-old teen. <\/p>\n<p>The driver of the Acclaim died at the scene of the accident. Two other teenage female passengers in her car also suffered life-threatening injuries. The driver of the Jeep was also seriously injured, and he along with the two teenagers were flown to an area hospital for medical treatment. <\/p>\n<p>When people suffer serious <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident injuries<\/a>, they turn to personal injury attorneys to identify the responsible parties and hold them accountable. Attorneys representing injured victims evaluate all of the available information relevant to the case. For example, police accident reports, results of toxicology reports and field sobriety tests, statements from eyewitnesses and images captured by traffic cameras all reveal important information. A settlement may be negotiated, or attorneys may put together a civil lawsuit claiming personal injury or wrongful death. <\/p>\n<p>In a case where an accident occurs because someone has driven the wrong way in traffic, the driver may be deemed liable for injuries if it can be proven that the accident could have been avoided if he or she had not been negligent in some way. For example, distraction from a mobile device or impairment from drugs or alcohol can render a driver incapable of safely monitoring road and traffic conditions. In addition, if the negligence directly contributed to a death, then the families of the victims have a claim for wrongful death. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>Akron, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.akron.com\/akron-ohio-community-news.asp?aID=23662\" target=\"_blank\">Bath teen killed in car accident<\/a>&#8220;, Maria Lindsay, August 07, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Police reports indicate that a motor vehicle accident in Ohio on the evening of Aug. 3 killed a teenager.
