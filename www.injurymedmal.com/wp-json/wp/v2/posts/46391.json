If you believe that you were not to blame for the accident, it is important to hold the other party responsible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How can I prove fault after a car accident?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An investigation will be made by your insurance company after the car accident, and they will work to establish what led up to the event. If you have any evidence relating to the accident, you should provide this information. You may have seen the other driver using their phone before the collision, for example. This could suggest that they were engaging in distracted driving. This type of eyewitness evidence can be verified through further investigations, for example through tracking their call history.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What damages may I be able to claim?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In theory, you will be entitled to the coverage of all financial expenses as well as damages for the pain and suffering that the accident caused you.
