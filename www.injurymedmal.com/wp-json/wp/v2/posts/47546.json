Two vehicles were engulfed in flames after the crash occurred. The occupants of the vehicles were all Marion residents.<\/p>\n<p>The accident happened around 3:25 p.m. on Delaware Avenue in the area of Executive Drive when the 43-year-old driver of a Ford Focus was heading south and allegedly hit a Honda Fit that was driven by a 49-year-old woman. The 2003 Focus continued on and hit a 1994 Buick, a Dodge Durango, Ford Taurus and a Ford Edge, according to a representative of the Ohio State Police.<\/p>\n<p>The occupants of the Buick, the 45-year-old female driver, a 50-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman were all killed by flames that engulfed their vehicle. The male driver of the Durango, 41, his wife and six children were able to get out of the vehicle before it too was engulfed in flames. The man&#8217;s child was caught in her car seat, but he was able to free her in time. She was taken to an area children&#8217;s hospital for burns she suffered in the accident. The Focus driver suffered minor injuries, according to authorities. <\/p>\n<p>The investigation into the accident is ongoing. Police are waiting for test results to see if alcohol or drugs were involved.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">Car accident injuries<\/a>, as in this case, may be fatal. Although the reason the driver lost control of his vehicle is unknown at this time, if he was driving impaired, he may be held accountable for the deaths of other motorists. Their family may suffer considerable financial loss and might be unable to pay expenses. An attorney might offer them insight into ways they may be able to recover the financial damages by evaluating the accident for a wrongful death claim. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> NBC, &#8220;3 Killed In Multi-Vehicle Crash Along S.R. 423 In Marion,&#8221; A.
