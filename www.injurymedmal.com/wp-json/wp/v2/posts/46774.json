The victim&#8217;s family had accused Facebook of acting negligently for not spotting and then reporting the posted threats by the shooter. <\/p>\n<p>The shooter shared the video of himself shooting the 74-year-old man on a street in Cleveland. His video remained live on the site for around two hours, and it was shared and viewed millions of times during that period. A few days later, the shooter also shot and killed himself following a police chase in Pennsylvania. <\/p>\n<p>Despite the role of Facebook postings in the incident, a judge in Cleveland said that the social media giant couldn&#8217;t be held responsible for the <a href=\"https:\/\/cumberlink.com\/news\/local\/state-and-regional\/facebook-dismissed-from-suit-involving-fatal-ohio-shooting-video\/article_0dded2d0-24c1-52bf-a1ee-79aee4d82bdd.html\" target=\"_blank\">murder<\/a>. Lawyers for the tech company said that the man&#8217;s family did not show that Facebook could have screened and found the post from one of its billions of users. Facebook, they argued, didn&#8217;t have the ability to act quickly in a way that could have prevented the death of the retiree. <\/p>\n<p>Representatives of the family said that they were considering their options moving forward and may file an appeal in the case. While Facebook was dismissed from the case, the family&#8217;s lawsuit is going forward against the estate of the shooter himself. <\/p>\n<p>A wrongful death lawsuit can help loved ones seek justice and accountability. Spouses, children or parents of a deceased loved one can consult with a <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">Columbus wrongful death attorney<\/a> about how they can seek compensation. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An Ohio judge dismissed Facebook from a lawsuit filed by the family of a man whose killer shot him and shared the video on the social media site.
