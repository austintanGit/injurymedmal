In some cases, family members can find solace in seeking justice for the deceased. This may be especially true for people who lose loved ones as a result of another person&#8217;s recklessness or negligence. Recently, the family of a 19-year-old Ohio teen who was killed in an auto accident in March filed a <a title=\"Wrongful death\" href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\" target=\"_blank\">wrongful death<\/a> suit against a toy company.<\/p>\n<p>A driver for the company was preoccupied with his cell phone when he lost control of a company-owned van. He subsequently struck the victim&#8217;s vehicle causing a severe accident. The collision occurred on Interstate 71 in March. The driver of the van reportedly lost control of his vehicle and swerved across all three lanes before striking the victim&#8217;s Pontiac as she was making her way onto the interstate from a rest area.<\/p>\n<p>The victim&#8217;s family members are requesting a jury trial as well as at least $25,000 in damages to help compensate for their loss. The family has also made a statement implicating the toy company in the accident because it hired the van driver. According to family members, the company was negligent when it failed to recognize the driver&#8217;s tendency toward reckless driving.<\/p>\n<p>According to reports, there are currently no official charges filed against the van driver. Ohio authorities are waiting to receive results of a toxicology test before making a judgment as to how to move forward. No reports have been issued concerning the van driver&#8217;s physical state following the accident.<\/p>\n<p>Monetary compensation for damages is never enough to replace the grief associated with the loss of a loved one. However, it can help offset funeral costs and other expenses in the event of a sudden and untimely loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Nbc4i.com, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www2.nbc4i.com\/news\/2011\/may\/18\/3\/family-files-suit-after-teen-dies-rest-area-crash-ar-494486\" target=\"_blank\">Family Files Suit After Teen Dies In Rest-Area Crash<\/a>,&#8221; Donna Willis, 18 May 2011<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The emotional impact of a fatal car accident can leave loved ones with emotional scars that last a lifetime.
