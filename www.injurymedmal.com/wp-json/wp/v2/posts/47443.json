The bad roads, however, have yet to be singled out by investigators as contributing to the loss of control the 36-year-old male driver of an SUV experienced when he attempted to pass another car.<\/p>\n<p>According to sheriff&#8217;s deputies, the SUV was heading west and entered the eastbound lane, reportedly striking a pickup truck head-on. The truck was driven by a 68-year-old man. Both men were injured and were first taken to local hospitals before being sent to MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland for additional treatment. Currently, their conditions are reported as fair and good, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The crash happened between Perry Park Road and Center Road. Authorities had to completely close North Ridge Road for about 30 minutes while attending the accident. No charges have been filed against either driver, but an investigation of the crash by the sheriff&#8217;s department is ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>An accident like this one raises questions about possible driver negligence. Perhaps the passing took place in a no-passing zone, or bad road conditions made higher speeds unsafe. When someone is <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">injured in an accident<\/a>, sometimes a personal injury claim is an appropriate means of recovering medical expenses and lost income. An attorney might be able to help such a client review accident reports for evidence of negligent driving. If a driver can be shown to have been negligent, a personal injury claim may have the potential to gain compensation for the injured person.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> WKYC, &#8220;Drivers recovering after Lake County head-on crash,&#8221; Feb. 3, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Preliminary reports from the Lake County Sheriff department about a Perry Township, Ohio, accident on North Ridge Road described road conditions as very poor.
