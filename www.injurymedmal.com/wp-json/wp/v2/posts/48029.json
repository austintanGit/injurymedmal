Police said that just before the <a title=\"car accident\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Other-Practice-Areas\/Catastrophic-Injuries\/\" target=\"_blank\">car accident<\/a>, the driver of the Acura crossed over the center line, but it is not known why. The car was crushed and the driver had to be extricated. He was in clear need of medical treatment and was rushed to Grant Medical Center, where he was eventually listed in serious condition.<\/p>\n<p>Truck and car accidents like this one are all too common, and it seems the driver of the smaller (or less substantial) vehicle is often the one who is injured most severely. In this case, the driver of the utility truck was unharmed and was able to speak with police at the scene of the car accident.<\/p>\n<p>In cases where victims require medical treatment, it is important that all parties involved in an accident contact their respective insurance companies. This step of the accident recovery process proves equally important in the case of uninsured motorist claims. Unfortunately, far too many people in Columbus are driving without insurance. And sometimes, insurance is not enough to offset the damages incurred in an accident.<\/p>\n<p>It is imperative that anyone involved in an accident that leads to a personal injury understands that he or she has the right to enlist the aid of legal counsel. A well-qualified attorney will likely be useful in helping to the injured party pursue compensation for their pain and suffering.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> NBC4i, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www2.nbc4i.com\/news\/2011\/sep\/06\/10\/west-side-crash-closes-hilliard-rome-road-ar-723890\" target=\"_blank\">Car &amp; Utility Truck Crash On West Side; 1 Hurt<\/a>,&#8221; Alex Mazer &amp; Donna Willis, Sept. 6, 2011<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One person was severely injured just outside of Columbus recently when an Acura sedan and a utility truck collided.
