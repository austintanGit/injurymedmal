The victim was a 59-year-old man from Toledo who drove a motorcycle when the accident happened at around 12:30 p.m. <\/p>\n<p>A news release from the Sandusky post of the OSHP stated that the accident occurred at Carroll-Erie Road and Ohio 2 when a 74-year-old man, from Northwood, traveled westbound on the highway in a 2013 Buick Lacrosse and swerved to the left of center into oncoming traffic. It seems that this driver wanted to avoid a rear-end collision with a vehicle stopped in front of him that was waiting to turn left. The man hit a 2008 Harley Davidson traveling east head-on instead, and both vehicles stopped south off Ohio 2. <\/p>\n<p>The motorcycle caught on fire after the collision, and the motorcyclist was ejected from his vehicle. The motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet at the time of the wreck, and he died at the scene of the crash. The driver of the Buick received treatment at Mercy St. Charles Hospital after suffering non-life threatening injuries, and criminal charges may follow as the accident investigation progresses. The authorities have not yet said whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the wreck. <\/p>\n<p>If a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a> takes the life of a loved one, then a family might be entitled to compensation for expenses related to funeral costs or emotional losses when a negligent driver caused the crash. In many cases with motorcycles, other motorists fail to check the roadway for these vehicles, and this might constitute negligence. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Sandusky Register, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sanduskyregister.com\/news\/law-enforcement\/7835471\" target=\"_blank\">Updated: 1 dead, 1 injured in Ottawa County crash<\/a>&#8220;, 04\/12\/2015 <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Ohio State Highway Patrol reported a crash in Ottawa County that killed one person on April 12 on Ohio 2.
