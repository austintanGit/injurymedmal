This could be harmful to patients because the two types of diabetes require different treatments.<\/p>\n<p>In the study, scientists examined more than 30,000 cases of adult-onset diabetes. They found that nearly 560 of the cases were diagnosed after the appearance of pancreatic disease. However, doctors diagnosed 88 percent of the cases linked to pancreatic disease as type 2 diabetes and only 3 percent as type 3c. The researchers believe this indicates that many cases were misdiagnosed. As a result, the authors of the study recommended that doctors improve their ability to recognize and diagnose type 3c diabetes. They also recommended that patients who are concerned that they have been misdiagnosed mention the University of Surry study to their primary care physicians.<\/p>\n<p>Diabetes misdiagnoses can cause patients to endure unneeded treatments and experience a worsened condition. Victims of misdiagnoses may benefit from discussing their cases with <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">Columbus, Ohio, medical malpractice injury lawyers<\/a>.
