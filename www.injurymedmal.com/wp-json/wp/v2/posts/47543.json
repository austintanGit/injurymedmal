Investigators placed hidden cameras within the premises with the family members&#8217; consent to uncover the possible illegal activities. The footage allegedly revealed failure by some employees to meet the nutritional, personal and medical needs of residents. These employees allegedly created falsified documentation in an effort to cover up the bad care.<\/p>\n<p>The owner of the facility was indicted on the first-degree felony of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, which would bear a mandatory sentence of 10 years in prison. He was also indicted on 17 counts of forgery and two counts of Medicaid fraud. He is facing a total of 39 criminal charges, and the facility itself has been indicted for 16 alleged offenses. None of the staff members have yet been indicted.<\/p>\n<p>Workers in care facilities may engage in and attempt to hide negligent behavior under pressure from superiors to meet outside approval.
