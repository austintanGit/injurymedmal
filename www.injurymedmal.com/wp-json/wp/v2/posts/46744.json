You don&#8217;t have any control over other drivers, but there are always things you can do to enhance your safety and attempt to avoid an accident.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best things you can do is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geico.com\/more\/driving\/auto\/car-safety-insurance\/defensive-driving\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">become a defensive driver<\/a>. Here are five tips that will help you to do just that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Always plan ahead.<\/strong> Think about what you&#8217;re getting into before you ever put your car in drive. For example, if you know you&#8217;ll sit in rush hour traffic, prepare your mind accordingly. This will help you make sound decisions when the time comes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t lose sight of others.<\/strong> You can&#8217;t watch everyone all the time, but you should keep a close eye on drivers close to your vehicle. If you spot someone driving in a reckless or aggressive manner, create as much space between your vehicles as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Slow down.<\/strong> You shouldn&#8217;t drive dangerously slow, but you must keep one eye on your speed at all times. There&#8217;s a speed limit for a reason, and you should follow it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t drive aggressively.<\/strong> If other drivers become aggressive, it&#8217;s easy to fall into the same trap. You may assume you have to do the same in order to protect yourself. This isn&#8217;t true. You should remain a defensive driver regardless of what&#8217;s happening around you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Becoming distracted.<\/strong> Being a defensive driver means paying attention to the road at all times. You shouldn&#8217;t send text messages while you&#8217;re driving, talk on the phone, eat or drink.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are many types of distractions, all of which increase the risk of an accident. Don&#8217;t let these become a problem for you. When you actively try to become a defensive driver, it&#8217;s much easier to make progress. And as you make progress, you&#8217;ll realize that you feel better about your ability to remain safe.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">part of a motor vehicle accident<\/a>, pull to safety and take steps to protect your health and well-being. For example, call 911 and avoid confrontation with the person who caused the accident.<\/p>\n<p>When the time comes, contact your insurance agent to file a claim and take steps to protect your legal rights.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are safe drivers, reckless drivers and those who lie somewhere in between.
