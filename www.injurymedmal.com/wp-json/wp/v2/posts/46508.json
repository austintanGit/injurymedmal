One is to slow down, even traveling below the speed limit if necessary. At the same time, truckers should maintain a buffer zone from the vehicle in front since snow and ice increase a truck&#8217;s stopping distance. Always avoid getting into packs on the highway.<\/p>\n<p>In severe weather that causes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smart-trucking.com\/driving-in-snow.html\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poor visibility<\/a>, truckers are advised against following the taillights of the vehicle in front because this means they are traveling too close. As always, truckers should keep a safe distance from the car in front so that they can avoid any errors that the driver of that car makes. When the weather gets too severe, drivers should pull over.<\/p>\n<p>Truckers should avoid overuse of foot brakes unless the entire truck is facing straight, and they should keep away from the jake brake. Having a full gas tank puts extra weight over the drive tires, improving traction. Proper truck maintenance is essential. It&#8217;s good to have a roadside emergency kit as well.<\/p>\n<p>Bad weather does not excuse truckers from the duty to keep their vehicle under control. If a careless or <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/truck-accidents\/\">distracted truck driver<\/a> causes an accident, occupants of other vehicles may sustain severe injuries that require lengthy periods of expensive medical care and treatment, during which they in some cases are unable to return to work, thereby exacerbating their financial difficulties. They may want to have a experienced attorney&#8217;s help in pursuing compensation from the negligent truck driver and, in some cases, the trucking company itself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winter conditions pose a serious challenge to commercial truckers in Ohio and across the U.S., so it would be a good idea to consider a few tips.
