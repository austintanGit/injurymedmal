This year, Halloween will land midweek on a Tuesday. While kids may be out walking on dark streets that night, according to the Ohio Department of Public Safety, the potential for a drunk driving accident may actually be higher during the weekend before or after the holiday.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are other days to watch out for<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Ohio, there were 11,958 crashes involving alcohol-impaired drivers just last year and October is the third highest month for injuries due to alcohol-related crashes. The potentially more dangerous nights for drunk driving crashes are on the weekends\u2014like the one leading up to Halloween or the weekend following it\u2014as local bars host themed events and residents may host parties with alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>Statistically Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays in Ohio have the highest rates of fatal crashes, with Saturdays being the peak.<\/p>\n<p>And if you think drunk driving is dangerous, being a passenger in a car with an impaired driver, or being on the road with other intoxicated drivers can be equally as scary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be aware of your risks and rights<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Keep these significant risks in mind before getting into a car on Halloween weekend:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the driver wearing a mask while driving? It can inhibit vision and result in being pulled over.<\/li>\n<li>Is your ride home a safe, sober driver or sober car service? Be sure of the driver\u2019s sobriety before getting into any car.<\/li>\n<li>Do you know the alcohol amount in every alcoholic drink consumed by the driver? Bartenders or partygoers making drinks can tip people over the driving limit without their knowledge.<\/li>\n<li>Did the driver take recreational or prescription drugs within 24 hours? They may count as driving under the influence or mix with alcohol to inhibit the ability to drive.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are in a car crash and suspect any driver of being under the influence, it\u2019s essential to <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/drunk-driving-accidents\/\">understand your legal rights<\/a> after the accident. Knowing who to call can ensure those involved are held responsible and you get fair compensation for your damages.
