Reportedly, a vehicle that had stalled on Ohio State Route 13 was rear-ended by a pickup truck near Kochheiser Road just prior to 5 p.m. <\/p>\n<p>According to OHP, three people suffered injuries requiring emergency transport to MedCentral Mansfield Hospital, where officials indicated that their injuries were non-life-threatening. Authorities reported that the stalled vehicle, a gray Cadillac, had caused traffic on the highway to decelerate. The vehicle that rear-ended it, a maroon Ford truck, apparently did not decelerate in accordance with the rest of traffic. As a result, the driver of the truck crashed into the Cadillac, authorities said. <\/p>\n<p>Both the Cadillac and the Ford received extensive damage on account of the collision. Law enforcement officials indicated that they do not suspect that drugs or alcohol were involved in the accident. However, an investigation into the cause of the accident is still ongoing, authorities noted. <\/p>\n<p>In cases like this one, further investigation may help officials reconstruct the circumstances that led up to the collision as well as the factors that contributed to it. Key pieces of evidence in this respect sometimes do not come to light until several days or weeks following the accident. Furthermore, in some cases, private investigators must be employed in order to reconstruct the wreck in a total and accurate way. <\/p>\n<p>Doing so may be very important for accident victims who wish to seek restitution in civil court for the various damages they suffered as a consequence of the crash. In order to prevail in a civil suit, accident victims and their legal counsel must proffer evidence showing that another party&#8217;s negligence or recklessness led to their <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident injuries<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>Mansfield News Journal, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com\/story\/news\/local\/2014\/10\/29\/three-hospitalized-ohio-crash\/18154133\/\" target=\"_blank\">Three hospitalized after Ohio 13 crash<\/a>&#8220;, October 29, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An Oct. 26 traffic accident in Mansfield left three people injured, according to the Ohio Highway Patrol.
