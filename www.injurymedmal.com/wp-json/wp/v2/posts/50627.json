While many people equate the onset of bedsores with nursing home residents who are confined to a wheelchair or bed, these pressure sores can develop on the skin under numerous conditions. A medical staff must ensure not only the proper hydration of patients but that they are continuously moved to reduce or eliminate the pressure on certain body parts.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What are bed sores?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Bed sores, also called decubitus ulcers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/bed-sores\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20355893\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">develop after prolonged periods of pressure against the skin<\/a>. These sores often affect areas of the body that have little muscle or tissue separating the skin from the bones such as the heels, hips, shoulder blades or tailbone. Without the proper care and attention, the condition can quickly progress through numerous stages of severity including skin damage, tenderness, cellulitis, bone infections and sepsis.
