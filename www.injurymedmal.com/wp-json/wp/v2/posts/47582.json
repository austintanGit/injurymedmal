According to the report, the crash took place at approximately 10:25 a.m. at the intersection of State Route 528 and State Route 86. <\/p>\n<p>The authorities stated that the 57-year-old man was operating a 2000 Suzuki motorcycle in the southbound lanes of State Route 528. As he approached the intersection, a 36-year-old Pennsylvania woman who was driving a 2008 Ford Taurus reportedly did not stop before entering the intersection and collided with the motorcyclist. <\/p>\n<p>The man, who was not wearing a helmet or any other protective gear, was taken to Cleveland Metro Hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later. The woman was taken to Geauga Hospital with injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening. At the time the report was released, the authorities were still investigation the cause of the accident. However, it was not believed that alcohol and excessive speed were factors in the fatal accident. <\/p>\n<p>No matter what may cause an accident that involves a motorcycle, the motorcyclist could suffer serious and potentially life-threatening injuries, which could include severe road rash, spinal cord injuries or traumatic brain injuries. However, family members who lose a loved one in a motorcycle accident may have the option to file a <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">wrongful death<\/a> claim against the liable motorist or his or her insurance company. If the family decides to do so, they could pursue compensation for both economic and non-economic damages, such as loss of expected financial support, medical and burial costs, and loss of society. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>Star Beacon , &#8220;Madison man dies in motorcycle crash&#8221;, April 21, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A fatal accident involving a motorcycle and a vehicle left a 57-year-old Ohio man dead on April 20.
