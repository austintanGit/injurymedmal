What&#8217;s worse is that many professional drivers are among the most sleep deprived. <\/p>\n<p>Researchers found that the number of Americans getting seven hours of sleep or less per night jumped from 30.9% in 2010 to 35.9% in 2018. However, the numbers are even worse among those working in the transport industry. The study found that the number of transport drivers not getting adequate rest spiked from 32% to 41% over the last decade, which is an increase of 28%. Meanwhile, the study found that 50% of police and military members, 45% of health care support workers and 41% of production workers fail to get enough sleep within each 24-hour period. According to the lead author of the study, the research team couldn&#8217;t identify specific reasons why people are getting less sleep. <\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.overdriveonline.com\/study-truckers-rank-high-among-sleep-deprived-workers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<\/a> also found that the number of men getting seven hours or less of sleep increased from 30.5% in 2010 to around 35.5% in 2018. For women, the numbers jumped from 31.2% in 2011 to 35.8% in 2018. The numbers of white, black, Asian and multiracial adults reporting inadequate sleep also increased over the same period of time. Studies have found that sleep deprivation is linked to a range of physical and mental health issues. It can also increase the risk of injury, reduce productivity and increase the risk of premature death. <\/p>\n<p>People who are injured in an accident caused by a drowsy truck driver might have a strong personal injury claim. <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/truck-accidents\/\">Columbus, Ohio, truck accident injury lawyers<\/a> may evaluate a victim&#8217;s case and explain the legal remedies available.
