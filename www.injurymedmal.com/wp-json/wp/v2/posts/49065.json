But while most people would not dare get behind the wheel after drinking, an alarming number of them drive under the influence of something even deadlier: the smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>According to a\u00a0recent report, the number of \u201cphone addicts\u201d on the road doubled between 2018 and 2019. Here is how a phone addict behaves when behind the wheel:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drives 1.5 times more than the average driver<\/li>\n<li>Spends three times more drive time using their phone than the average driver<\/li>\n<li>Actively ignores the road 28 percent of the time while driving<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What\u2019s more concerning is while 85 percent of surveyed phone addicts admit distracted driving is a problem, 90 percent believe they are safe drivers.<\/p>\n<h2>How dangerous is distracted driving?<\/h2>\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control defines distracted driving as driving while doing another activity that takes your attention from the road. A glance at your phone may seem harmless, but a study from the University of Utah found cell phone drivers were just as bad and sometimes worse than drunk drivers at driving.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the study found people who use phones while driving:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are more likely to get into an accident than the average driver<\/li>\n<li>Drive more slowly<\/li>\n<li>Are 9 percent slower to apply the brakes<\/li>\n<li>Are 24 percent more variant in their following distance<\/li>\n<li>Are 19 percent slower to get back to normal speed after braking<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Also, while drunk drivers are generally the most active on the road between 12 a.m. and 3 a.m., phone addicts are driving when roads are busy, between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.<\/p>\n<h2>The bottom line<\/h2>\n<p>Phone addicts today pose a more significant threat to public safety than those who drink and drive. To protect the lives of you and those around you, set the smartphone aside and keep yourself distraction-free.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drunk driving endangers the lives of both the driver and others on the road.
