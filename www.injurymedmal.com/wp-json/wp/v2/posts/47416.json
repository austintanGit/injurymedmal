The head-on collision between two cars occurred near the Airport Highway intersection, according to the Ohio State Patrol. <\/p>\n<p>Authorities reported that the 41-year-old woman behind the wheel of a 1999 Ford Contour drifted left over the center the line while traveling north. She entered the path of a southbound 2006 Cadillac STS occupied by two women. The 76-year-old driver of the Cadillac suffered serious injuries. She was transported to the Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center. Her passenger, 60, had minor injuries and went to Fulton County Health Center for treatment. <\/p>\n<p>The highway patrol had to shut down traffic for a while during the rescue and clean up. A trooper said that the woman driving the Ford was suspected to have consumed alcohol and became sleepy behind the wheel. She also was badly injured and admitted to Mercy St. Vincent for medical attention. <\/p>\n<p>It is not uncommon for a person to have a long recovery from serious <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident injuries<\/a>. He or she may need ongoing therapy for rehabilitation and could miss time at work. An injured person who believes that the other driver&#8217;s negligence caused the accident may choose to discuss the matter with an attorney. If the other driver was drinking, speeding or distracted by a cell phone, then that person might be held responsible for damages with a personal injury claim. An attorney could help prepare the lawsuit and assist in negotiations with an insurance company to gain compensation for medical bills and lost income. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> NBC24, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbc24.com\/news\/story.aspx?id=1185372#.VSBw_JP9t-x\" target=\"_blank\">Troopers say alcohol a factor in Fulton County serious injury crash<\/a>,&#8221; Amulya Raghuveer, April 1, 2015 <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two women were seriously injured, and another woman was hurt in a car accident north of Wauseon, Ohio, on State Highway 108.
