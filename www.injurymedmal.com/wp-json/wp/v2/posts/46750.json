People in Ohio might be interested in the details of the case as it raises issues of employer negligence and discrimination. The complaint alleges that Amazon failed to provide benefits that were mandated by contract, including disability compensation. These failures led to the employee&#8217;s death, according to the plaintiffs. The employee, who was 53 years old, died of a heart attack. <\/p>\n<p>According to the complaint, the employee worked as a senior human resources business analyst for Amazon beginning in 2015. The next year, the employee disclosed to Amazon that he was HIV positive and had some other medical conditions that required him to change his clothes and use the restroom frequently. The employee asked for a leave of absence based on the short-term disability plan at Amazon. The plan would have entitled the employee to benefits. <\/p>\n<p>The company granted his request until May 2016, when it said there wasn&#8217;t enough medical proof to continue the benefits. The employee made <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2018\/amazon-sued-family-deceased-employee-claiming-wrongful-death-discrimination\/\" target=\"_blank\">several appeals<\/a> to Amazon and asked for an arrangement whereby he could work from home, says the complaint, and Amazon denied his requests. The man&#8217;s attorney said he was not terminally ill but he did have medical issues. <\/p>\n<p>In a case where the negligence or wrongdoing leads to a person&#8217;s death, legal action may be warranted. <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">Wrongful death attorneys<\/a> might be able to help in such a case by gathering evidence, securing expert witness reports or otherwise preparing for trial. Legal counsel could identify parties who have liability or negotiate the terms of a monetary settlement. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is facing a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of a former employee.
