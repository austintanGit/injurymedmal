Emergency responders arrived at the scene and extricated the woman from the SUV.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Ohio Highway Patrol, the expectant mother was airlifted to a local hospital where she and her fetus were treated for injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening. The driver of the SUV and three child passengers were also taken to a hospital and treated for minor injuries.<\/p>\n<p>The 52-year-old driver of the 18-wheeler, which was parked at the time of the accident, was also injured, though he reportedly did not require medical attention.<\/p>\n<p>According to the initial accident report, the SUV driver dozed off at the wheel, drifted from the Interstate and failed to reduce the vehicle&#8217;s speed before colliding with the tractor-trailer parked at the rest stop.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of a news report, the Ohio Highway Patrol was still trying to determine whether criminal charges would be filed in connection with what appears to be a case of negligent driving.<\/p>\n<p>Although all parties involved in this accident were very lucky, accidents involving semis are often much more serious and can cause severe injuries.
