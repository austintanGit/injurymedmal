It is very important that you handle the insurance claim properly after the accident because your actions can affect what type of financial assistance you get after the accident. Because of the shock of being in an accident, you might not be able to think clearly after the accident. It is crucial that you learn how to handle claims before you are placed in that situation.<\/p>\n<p>As soon as you are hit, you need to start taking notes. If possible, write down what you can remember about the accident. Get any information you can gather from people who witnessed the accident, as well as the information from the other party involved in the <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/\">car crash<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You should get medical care if you need it, but you need to notify your insurance company of the accident as soon as possible. Make sure that you are ready to take notes of who you speak to and what he or she says. You should be ready to answer questions and provide information about the accident, but remember not to admit fault for the accident in any manner.<\/p>\n<p>If you are asked to sign any waiver or release, make sure that you understand the legal implications of signing the form. The settlement that you receive from the insurer can vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the accident. In most cases, the settlement is negotiable. You should check into the financial aspects of the accident to determine if you are getting a fair settlement. This means looking into medical costs for now and the future, as well as looking into other expenses, such as lost wages, lodging costs and other accident-related expenses.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> FindLaw, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/injury.findlaw.com\/car-accidents\/car-insurance-claims-dos-and-don-ts.html\" target=\"_blank\">Car Insurance Claims: Dos and Don&#8217;ts<\/a>,&#8221; accessed June 22, 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a car accident, you will likely have to deal with an insurance claim.
