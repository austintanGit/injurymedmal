What is clear is that a blow sustained to the head and brain can be a devastating and potentially fatal injury.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A tragic incident in which a soccer referee died from a brain injury recently made national headlines. A 17-year-old male suspect is currently in police custody awaiting criminal charges in the 46-year-old referee&#8217;s death. The brain injury stemmed from an argument that ensued related to a call the referee made during a soccer game. The 17-year-old became upset over the call and ended up punching the referee squarely in the face.<\/p>\n<p>Reeling from the blow, the 46-year-old remained conscious but complained of feeling dizzy and nauseous. The situation took a turn for the worse when he began vomiting blood and he was rushed to the hospital. After being admitted, the 46-year-old&#8217;s brain continued to swell and he slipped into a coma. He died a week later as a result for the traumatic brain injury and subsequent brain swelling and damage.<\/p>\n<p>This incredibly sad and tragic incident proves how even one blow to the head can result in a severe and potentially fatal brain injury. By the time such an injury has occurred, doctors are in a race against time to control the swelling in the brain that can cause irreversible brain damage and even lead to death.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals who have sustained a brain injury as a result of the negligent actions of another, whether it be in a car accident or a medical procedure, may want to consult with an attorney. In such cases, a lawsuit may help an injured individual recover compensation related to their injuries and medical expenses and needs.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:\u00a0<\/b>CBS News, &#8220;Soccer referee&#8217;s death shows how dangerous head blows can be,&#8221; Ryan Jaslow, May 6, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The human brain is an intricate and delicate organ.
