And, if you are like most other drivers, you have probably felt a stab of nervousness as a big rig has drifted into your lane or come barreling past you on the highway.<\/p>\n<p>While there are generally fewer instances of accidents involving a semitruck than there are collisions involving only passenger vehicles, the consequence of these wrecks are often far more devastating.<\/p>\n<p>Part of staying safe on the road is understanding what types of dangerous situations you might experience along with their causes. If you know what to watch out for when driving near semitrucks, you will have a better chance of avoiding an accident. Here are some common <a href=\"https:\/\/injury.findlaw.com\/car-accidents\/common-causes-of-commercial-truck-accidents.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">causes of truck collisions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Collisions caused by other drivers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In many cases, truck accidents happen because of the actions of drivers operating passenger vehicles. Usually, these drivers do not fully understand the limited performance abilities of large commercial rigs.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a driver might cut off a truck and cause an accident because the semi needs much more time to slow down or stop and cannot adjust as quickly as a sedan can. Driving in a &#8220;no-zone,&#8221; or blind spot, of a truck can be extremely dangerous as well. You may be totally invisible to the truck driver and, thinking the lane is clear, the semi operator might change lanes and sideswipe you.<\/p>\n<p>Also, many drivers fail to speed up or slow down when a big rig is entering the highway, changing lanes or merging. If you see a truck making such a move, it is always best to simply get out of the way to avoid a collision.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Collisions caused by commercial drivers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In some cases, a truck accident is the fault of the truck driver. For example, you have probably heard about truck accidents where the operator has fallen asleep due to pressure to meet delivery deadlines. Many truck companies have strict schedules that they have to stick to which causes management to put pressure on their drivers to drive as much as possible to meet these deadlines.<\/p>\n<p>This can lead to speeding, driving drowsy and even distracted driving. In addition, if a load is improperly secured, it could result in an accident. A truck hauling items on a flatbed might lose the load and cause a car wreck if the tie downs are not properly tied and latched.<\/p>\n<p>If you have been the victim of a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/truck-accidents\/\">truck accident<\/a>, keep in mind that you have options. You might be able to file a claim for compensation for your injuries and other damages that resulted due to a wreck with a semitruck.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you live in the Columbus area, you have probably found yourself sharing the road with large commercial trucks at one time or another.
