You know your child had an accident, but there&#8217;s not all that much exterior damage. Your child is too young to identify symptoms or tell you about them. What should you look for?<\/p>\n<p>The brain does have some cushioning thanks to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds it. However, this is not always enough to stop <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/traumatic-brain-injuries\/\">internal injuries<\/a>, even when exterior damage is limited. For instance, perhaps your child was wearing a bike helmet and so there are no lacerations, but the brain still moved violently within the skull at the moment of impact. Major symptoms of an internal injury include:<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Seizures, even those that occur relatively long after the incident.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Losing consciousness, even for just 30 seconds or so.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Issues with vision or speech. The child may seem disoriented or confused.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Issues with abnormal breathing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Blood or other fluid coming out of the mouth, ear or nose.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Pupils that do not dilate properly. For example, one could be larger than the other.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Stiffness and neck pain. If the child can&#8217;t tell you about the pain, it may still be obvious when he or she moves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; General weakness. In the worst cases, this could even result in paralysis, which could be temporary or permanent, depending on the injury.<\/p>\n<p>If your child has suffered a brain injury due to someone else&#8217;s negligence, you may be able to seek compensation. After all, medical care can be expensive and some brain injuries can impact a child for life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> KidsHealth from Nemours, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/kidshealth.org\/en\/parents\/head-injury.html\" target=\"_blank\">Head Injuries<\/a>,&#8221; accessed March 24, 2017<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It can be hard for parents to spot an internal head injury.
