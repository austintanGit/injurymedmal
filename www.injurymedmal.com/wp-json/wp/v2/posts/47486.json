The collision took place on the Lofton Henderson Memorial Bridge when the 24-year-old man driving the postal truck lost control and struck a 1996 Buick Riviera head-on. There were no other people involved in the accident.<\/p>\n<p>Officers from the Lorain Police Department Traffic Bureau reported to the crash scene at approximately 5 p.m. According to police, the roadway where the accident happened was icy and partially covered in snow, and they do not believe that alcohol or drugs played any role in the car accident.<\/p>\n<p>Following the crash, firefighters extricated the mail carrier from his truck, and he was transported to MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland for the treatment of critical injuries. He reportedly lost consciousness temporarily after suffering from a head contusion and a broken wrist. The driver of the Buick, a 31-year-old woman, was also removed from her vehicle before being taken to Mercy Regional Medical Center in Lorain with moderate injuries. The bridge was completely shut down for more than two hours after the accident while police began an investigation.<\/p>\n<p>A person who has been injured in this type of crash may want to seek some reimbursement for their medical expenses and lost wages if they were forced to miss work to recover in the hospital or at home. A car accident victim may be able to claim damages in a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">personal injury claim<\/a> as long as they can show sufficient evidence that the accident was not their fault. To ensure their claim is well supported with appropriate evidence, many car accident victims choose to enlist the help of an attorney.<\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>The Morning Journal , &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.morningjournal.com\/general-news\/20141113\/two-sent-to-hospital-after-crash-on-lofton-henderson-bridge\" target=\"_blank\">Two sent to hospital after crash on Lofton Henderson Bridge<\/a>&#8220;, Eric Bonzar, November 14, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ohio authorities reported recently on an accident in Lorain involving a U.S. postal truck that sent two people to the hospital on Nov. 13.
