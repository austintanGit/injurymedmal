As of 2012, there are around 8.5 million motorcycles on U.S. roadways. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 4,600 people were killed in motorcycle crashes during 2013, accounting for about 13 percent of all traffic-related fatalities in the country. More than half of these fatalities involved motorcyclists over the age of 40. <\/p>\n<p>The number of these motorcyclists dying in crashes has increased from 46 percent during 2003 to 56 percent by 2012, representing an overall increase of 63 percent. The fatality rate for motorcyclists under age 39 declined over the same period. Older riders, particularly those over 60, often suffer the most severe injuries in motorcycle accidents. The motorcyclist&#8217;s behavior may also be a contributing factor in causing an accident as well. <\/p>\n<p>Alcohol and speeding are both common factors in a significant number of fatal motorcycle crashes. During 2012, 27 percent of the riders killed in fatal accidents registered a blood-alcohol concentration that exceeded .08 percent. In contrast, the rates for drivers in passenger cars and light trucks were only 23 percent and 22 percent, respectively. Similarly, 34 percent of all <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iii.org\/issue-update\/motorcycle-crashes\" target=\"_blank\">fatal motorcycle crashes<\/a> are caused by speeding, while the rate for passengers and light trucks is only 18 percent and 8 percent, respectively. <\/p>\n<p>Anyone injured by a motorcycle crash caused by another person might benefit from consulting a lawyer. Legal counsel could be prepared to investigate the crash and help determine whether anyone else can be held accountable for the ensuing damages. In order to recover restitution for a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">traffic accident<\/a>, lawyers usually need to prove that the defendant is liable for exhibiting some degree of driver negligence. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ohio residents might wish to learn more about the safety risks associated with motorcycles.
