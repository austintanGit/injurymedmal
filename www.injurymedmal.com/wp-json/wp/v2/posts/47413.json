The accident took place just before 10 p.m., according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities said an 84-year-old Wellington man was traveling westbound on West Smith Road when he ran a stop sign and hit a 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser that was driving northbound on State Route 83. Both occupants of the Chrysler, a 25-year-old Wakeman woman and a 36-year-old Elyria woman, were ejected from the vehicle. They were taken to Medina Hospital where they later died from their injuries. The driver of the first vehicle and his passenger, an 80-year-old woman, were also taken to the hospital with serious injuries. They were eventually transferred to another area health care facility.<\/p>\n<p>The scene was investigated and cleared with the cooperation of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, the Medina County Sheriff&#8217;s Office and the Litchfield Fire and EMS units. The accident remains under investigation.<\/p>\n<p>When someone loses their life in a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a> caused by another driver, the decedent&#8217;s family may wish to consult with a lawyer. In some cases, it may be possible to use the accident investigation report, witness testimony and other evidence to build a strong wrongful death claim against the at-fault driver. While a civil lawsuit can never take away the pain of losing a loved one, it may bring needed financial relief to the family left behind. Possible compensatory damages include medical expenses before death, funeral and burial costs and loss of support. Other damages, such as pain and suffering before death and loss of companionship, may also be awarded by the court in some cases.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> WKYC, &#8220;2 women killed in Medina County crash,&#8221; April 20, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two Ohio residents were killed in a car crash in Litchfield Township on April 19.
