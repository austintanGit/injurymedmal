Police said the fatal accident occurred on Diley Road in Pickerington at about 4:45 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>A car carrying the 82-year-old woman and her 79-year-old husband was traveling north on the road when a southbound pickup truck that allegedly crossed the centerline veered into its lane. The resulting collision left the 82-year-old woman and her husband with injuries requiring hospitalization.<\/p>\n<p>The woman ultimately died from her injuries at the hospital. Officials there listed the 79-year old man in stable condition. Furthermore, a 19-year-old person was also listed in stable condition at the hospital after suffering injuries in the accident; yet, authorities did not disclose the person&#8217;s identity nor explain how the person was involved in the crash. Police indicated that they are still investigating the accident.<\/p>\n<p>There are numerous possible causes for traffic accidents like this one. For example, the police investigation might hypothetically conclude that the accident cannot be attributed to driver error, and follow-up investigations may reveal that a poorly maintained roadway was the major contributing factor in the crash.<\/p>\n<p>If that were the case, the people who suffered damages as a result of the accident may seek financial compensation for those damages by filing a civil claim against the governmental entity responsible for the poorly maintained roadway. While the injured victims may retain a personal injury lawyer to file suit, certain family members of the deceased victim may file a wrongful death lawsuit. Claimants in both types of lawsuits must demonstrate the specific damages they suffered before receiving restitution from the at-fault party.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:\u00a0<\/b>Vindy.com, &#8220;Former Austintown woman dies in crash near Columbus -&#8220;, June 06, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On June 5, an 82-year-old woman reportedly died and two other people suffered injuries in a head-on collision near Columbus.
