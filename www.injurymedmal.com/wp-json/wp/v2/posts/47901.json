However, medication and pharmacy errors can cause serious personal injuries, and it is patients who are left to pick up the pieces.<\/p>\n<p>At least 1.5 million people are harmed each year from medication errors. According to a report released by the Institute of Medicine, hospitals experience at least one error in medication per patient each day.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes patients misunderstand directions and cause their own medication errors. Still, there are other times when a doctor prescribes the wrong medication or the pharmacist makes a mistake in filling a prescription. In these cases, the patient may be entitled to compensation for damages suffered as a result of medical negligence.<\/p>\n<p>When a hospital or pharmacist fails to meet a reasonable standard of care, and that failure causes harm, injury or even death to another person, then that person or their family is entitled to compensation through a medical malpractice claim. In the event that the patient is fatally injured, this may also lead to a wrongful death claim.<\/p>\n<p>Medical malpractice cases can be emotionally draining and complicated for all parties involved. Ohio residents who have been injured as a result of medical negligence should be fully aware of their rights as victims.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source: <\/strong>MPR News, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/minnesota.publicradio.org\/display\/web\/2012\/05\/02\/daily-circuit-medication-mistakes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preventing medication mistakes<\/a>,&#8221; May 2, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many people in Columbus rely on doctors to provide accurate medical diagnoses and pharmacists to properly fill prescriptions.
