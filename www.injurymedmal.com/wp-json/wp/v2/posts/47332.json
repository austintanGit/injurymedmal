In some cases, these residents are immobile. Immobile patients require frequent turning so that they don&#8217;t develop bedsores. When a patient who is immobile develops bedsores, it is usually assumed that they are a victim of nursing home neglect.<\/p>\n<p>We know that family members never want to see their loved one placed in harm&#8217;s way by the nursing home staff members who are supposed to care for the resident. In the case of bedsores, the initial damage to the skin might seem minor; however, those open sores are susceptible to pathogens. When pathogens make their way into the body through the open sores, serious infections can occur. Those infections can turn deadly if left untreated.<\/p>\n<p>Bedsores are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/bedsores\/basics\/definition\/con-20030848?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">staged<\/a> according to the tissue damage that is present. Stage I bedsores are the least serious and the least invasive. Stage IV bedsores are the most serious and often include serious tissue damage. In some cases, bedsores won&#8217;t be able to be staged because of dead, yellow or black tissue covering it.<\/p>\n<p>We know that thinking of the pain your loved one is probably going through is a horrible thought. Your loved one doesn&#8217;t deserve the searing, constant pain associated with bedsores. Taking action right away to help stop the nursing home neglect can put an end to your loved one&#8217;s suffering. Seeking compensation might help to cover your loved one&#8217;s bills and suffering.<\/p>\n<p>We can help you learn your options for stopping the neglect and filing claims for compensation.
