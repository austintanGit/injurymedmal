When <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/birth-injuries\/\">the birth of your child results in an injury<\/a>, we may be able to help you hold the negligent party responsible and help you get the compensation you deserve.<\/p>\n<p>There are many different issues that fall under the umbrella of birth injuries, ranging from general fetal distress to cerebral palsy. In any birth injury case, the doctor or other health care professionals must have made an error or missed something they should have caught that led to the problem or injury. Examples of this include improper monitoring after birth, which led to a complication that wasn&#8217;t caught in time to be prevented, or failure to treat umbilical cord entrapment, which can lead to cerebral palsy and other issues.<\/p>\n<p>In the best case scenario, the birth injury is easily treatable and requires minimal extra time in the hospital. However, in some cases, especially those involving lack of oxygen to the brain, the complications may be catastrophic and long term. When considering legal action, it&#8217;s important to consider both the present expenses and any emotional distress as well as the long-term financial impact of the injury and the child&#8217;s quality of life in the future.<\/p>\n<p>At Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble &amp; Dougherty, we&#8217;ve dealt with many of these cases and know what it takes to go up against hospitals and doctors in the courtroom. We can help you determine an appropriate settlement amount or help you prepare to take your case to trial.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Birth is one of the miracles of life, and while this should be a joyous time for families welcoming a new addition, the reality is that sometimes doctors and nurses make mistakes and the results can be disastrous.
