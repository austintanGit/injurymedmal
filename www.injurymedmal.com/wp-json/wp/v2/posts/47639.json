As the officer was leaving the patrol car, the suspect hit the vehicle with his truck, disabling it before he drove off. Another trooper attempted to stop him, and the suspect crashed into that patrol car as well. As he did after the first crash, the suspect fled the scene. <\/p>\n<p>According to Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers, the bizarre chase continued with two officers from New Boston in pursuit. The suspect hit one of the cruisers and evaded capture by driving over a grassy median. The chase came to an end after the suspect attempted to hit two more police cruisers and missed. The suspect drove off the roadway, and a cruiser blocked the vehicle, so the driver was unable to escape. The suspect was taken into custody. <\/p>\n<p>In total, four police vehicles were damaged, with three of the damaged vehicles being disabled. Two officers were treated for <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident injuries<\/a> and then released. The suspect has been arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including two counts of assault on a police officer and three counts of vandalism. <\/p>\n<p>Though the assault charges have to do with the suspect&#8217;s causing injuries to the officers, those injured still have the option of pursuing legal action against the suspect. Legal representation through a firm with experience in car accidents could help the injured plaintiffs to receive monetary assistance when paying for medical expenses and other damages incurred by the suspect&#8217;s actions. Compensation for serious injury sustained while driving can often make convalescence more successful, especially if it allows the injured person to take time off work as needed. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>WCHS, &#8220;Two officers injured, several cruisers damaged in pursuit crash&#8221;, Tiersa Davis, December 13, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An early-morning Dec. 13 car chase through Scioto County, Ohio, began when a patrol car pulled over a 27-year-old driver.
