However, the investigation remains open as investigators search for the reason why a westbound Toyota Camry crossed the highway&#8217;s center line and hit a Dodge Grand Caravan. <\/p>\n<p>The 77-year-old Columbus man driving the Caravan died in the crash. Emergency room personnel declared him dead when he arrived at the Grant Medical Center. <\/p>\n<p>The two people in the Camry, ages 79 and 73, also perished. An ambulance transported them to Mount Carmel East Hospital, where both were officially pronounced dead. They were from Gahanna. <\/p>\n<p>When car accident injuries kill someone, a surviving family member might need to pay for medical bills from the emergency rescue effort and burial expenses. Additionally, the household might have lost an important source of income. If the other driver&#8217;s negligence caused the accident, then a survivor has a right to <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">collect damages attributed to the death<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>An attorney could look at the accident investigation and maybe determine if negligence occurred. A failure to operate a vehicle safely can cause a driver to be labeled negligent. Intoxicated driving, distracted driving or speeding are examples of negligent actions. An attorney could support a survivor&#8217;s negotiations for an adequate settlement with an insurance company. If necessary, an attorney could also represent a survivor in court. In addition to an insurance company, the driver might also be held responsible for damages. That person&#8217;s assets might also be accessed to gain compensation for the survivor. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Newark Advocate, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newarkadvocate.com\/story\/news\/local\/2015\/04\/14\/three-killed-head-crash-identified\/25754711\/\" target=\"_blank\">Three killed in head-on crash are identified<\/a>,&#8221; April 17, 2015 <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A police sergeant in Pataskala said that alcohol or drug use was not suspected in the head-on collision that killed three people on Ohio 16 near Taylor Road in Licking County.
