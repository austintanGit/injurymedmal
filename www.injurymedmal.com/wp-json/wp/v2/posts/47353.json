Just because they are so widely available doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they are safe. A recent study noted that teens who drink energy drinks are more likely to suffer from a traumatic brain injury. In some cases, the teens mixed the energy drink with alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>In the study, which was conducted by researchers at St. Michael&#8217;s Hospital, the definition of a traumatic brain injury was one that led to an overnight stay in the hospital or at least five minutes of unconsciousness. The researchers looked at data from around 10,000 students who ranged in age from 11 to 20 years old.<\/p>\n<p>Out of the students who were interviewed, 22 percent reported that they had a TBI. Almost half of the TBIs reported within the previous year noted that the injury was sports-related. One neurosurgeon also reported that teens who consume energy drinks after a TBI might not recover optimally from the TBI because high levels of caffeine can change the body&#8217;s chemical state.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to energy drinks that are mixed with alcohol, the results are even more shocking. Teens who suffered a TBI were twice as likely to note that they mixed alcohol with the energy drink.<\/p>\n<p>All TBIs in children and teens are serious because the brain is still developing in adolescents. Anyone who has a child or teen who suffered a TBI might look into seeking compensation for the injury. Understanding the Ohio laws relating to these types of claims is vital so you can decide if you should pursue compensation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> University Herald, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.universityherald.com\/articles\/24000\/20150924\/energy-drinks-linked-to-brain-damage-in-teens.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Drinks Linked To Brain Damage In Teen<\/a>,&#8221; Sep. 24, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Energy drinks are widely available at many grocery stores and convenience stores.
