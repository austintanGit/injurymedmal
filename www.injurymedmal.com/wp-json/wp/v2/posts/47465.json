The accident happened around 5:25 p.m. <\/p>\n<p>The Wooster Post of the State Highway Patrol said a Subaru headed southbound on state Route 83 was attempting to pass a semi-truck in a no-passing zone near Pleasant Home Road when it encountered two northbound vehicles. Not having enough room to complete the pass, the Subaru lost control and struck the left side of the semi-truck. It then hit both of the oncoming vehicles, a Chrysler and a Chevrolet. The semi-truck was forced from the roadway and drove into a field. <\/p>\n<p>The Chevrolet driver was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. The Chrysler driver was treated by paramedics at the scene. The semi driver was transported to Lodi Hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. The Subaru driver was transported to Wooster Community Hospital and then airlifted to Cleveland&#8217;s MetroHealth Medical Center with undisclosed injuries. <\/p>\n<p>Authorities said they do not yet know if drugs or alcohol played a role in the accident. Police are still investigating the crash. <\/p>\n<p>When a driver attempts to pass a vehicle in a no-passing zone and causes a fatal head-on collision, he or she could be sued in civil court by victims who were injured as a result. With the help of a lawyer, injured parties could receive financial compensation for pain and suffering, medical expenses, rehabilitation costs and wages lost while they recovered. If a victim was killed in the <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a>, their family could file a wrongful death lawsuit seeking a monetary settlement for their losses, including funeral costs, loss of companionship, lost inheritance and other damages. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> WKYC, &#8220;One person dead, three hurt in Wayne County accident&#8221;, Jan. 6, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Jan. 6, one person was killed and three others were injured in a car accident in Wayne County.
