UM\/UIM covers you and your family when they are injured in a car accident by another driver who is uninsured, or who doesn&#8217;t have enough coverage to pay for the extent of the injuries they have caused. All Ohioans are required to carry automobile insurance, but many simply don&#8217;t.&nbsp; An even higher number of Ohio drivers&nbsp;simply purchase the state minimum which will not begin to cover the medical costs of injuries you receive in an accident, or the long term ramifications on your life.<\/p>\n<p>What happens when you are injured by a hit and run driver and the police are unable to identify the person who caused your injuries? What happens when a person has the state minimum insurance coverage and your medical bills are more than the level of their coverage?<\/p>\n<p>You are left to pay the difference. That stark reality is a hard fact that many injured victims must face each year. As experienced accident and injury attorneys who have served Columbus and Central Ohio for decades, we can tell you this happens more often than it should. The first place we will turn when our client&#8217;s injuries and costs exceed the coverage of the negligent party is their own UM\/UIM coverage. That&#8217;s why it is there, and yet insurance companies can make it quite difficult to collect on your own policy.<\/p>\n<p>We handle all of the legal issues necessary with all parties involved to ensure that our clients are justly compensated for what has happened. We strongly recommend that you call your insurance company or representative and raise your UM\/UIM coverage to the maximum level possible under your policy. This extra $30 to $50 a year will save you tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road, and make it possible for you to fully recover from an unforeseen accident.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uninsured\/Underinsured Motorist coverage, also known as UM\/UIM is some of the least expensive insurance you can buy, but it is one of the most important parts of your automobile insurance coverage.
