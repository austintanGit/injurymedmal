However, troopers said that their investigation into the collision would continue. The <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">fatal crash<\/a> occurred shortly before noon on U.S. Route 68 in Springfield.<\/p>\n<p>According to state troopers, the deceased man was proceeding northbound on U.S. Route 68 when a southbound GMC SUV turned directly into the path of his Toyota Yaris in the vicinity of Springfield-Xenia Road. Traffic on U.S. Route 68 was backed up for some time as car accident investigators began their preliminary investigation and maintenance crews arrived at the scene to clear debris from the roadway.<\/p>\n<p>The man was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency medical services personnel. Troopers report that the Springfield resident was wearing a safety belt at the time of the collision. The woman behind the wheel of the SUV and her male passenger were treated at an area medical facility and subsequently released.<\/p>\n<p>While the events leading up to this accident may not be immediately clear, collisions of this type are frequently caused by inattentive or distracted drivers. Drivers owe other road users a duty of care to remain alert and vigilant at all times, and they may face civil sanctions when this duty is not met. The families of those killed in a motor vehicle accident often struggle to cope financially when unexpected bills such as burial costs and medical expenses have to be paid soon after they have lost a source of household income. A personal injury attorney may seek to assist these families by filing a wrongful death lawsuit on their behalf against the negligent motorist responsible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> WHIO, &#8220;Troopers ID fatal crash victim in Clark County,&#8221; March 26, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Ohio State Highway Patrol did not immediately say what factors may have contributed to a late morning accident on March 26 in Clark County that claimed the life of a 64-year-old man.
