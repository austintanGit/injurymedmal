Authorities are continuing to investigate the causes of the <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a> and it remains unknown whether some form of chemical impairment may have played a factor. The incident is said to have occurred along U.S. Route 52 as it approached Altman Road around 3 in the afternoon on Jan. 2.<\/p>\n<p>Preliminary reports seem to indicate that the 56-year-old decedent was driving northbound in a 2002 Ford F-150; at some point, he somehow collided with the southbound 1997 Toyota 4-Runner being driven by the 29-year-old decedent. Speculation exists that the Toyota may have crossed the center line for unknown reasons. Emergency personnel took the 29-year-old to Anderson Mercy Hospital where he died due to his injuries, while the older victim was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash.<\/p>\n<p>After an accident such as this, it may be difficult to ascertain how and why events transpired if both available witnesses died as a result of the collision. However, there may be other ways of producing such a narrative, including reviewing available traffic cameras, analyzing the physical damage to both vehicles and perhaps performing toxicological exams on the victims to verify sobriety.<\/p>\n<p>While the immediate crash victims may not be able to receive compensation, family members forced to endure the pain and suffering of their loss may request such restitution on their behalf. In many cases, deceased victims leave behind dependents that relied upon them for financial support and may be unable to care for themselves in their absence. If the responsible party is also deceased following the incident, families may be able to demand reparation from his or her estate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<\/strong>WCPO, &#8220;Two killed in Monroe Township crash identified&#8221;, Maxim Alter, January 02, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Ohio State Highway Patrol reports that a 56-year-old man and a 29-year-old man have both died as a result of a crash near Monroe Township.
