It&#8217;s also illegal for drivers under the age of 18 to talk on a cellphone while driving. Ohio&#8217;s restrictions on cellphone use while driving were enacted in response to a growing number of serious and fatal car accidents caused by distracted drivers. While no states have enacted bans on all cellphone usage by drivers, a total of 11 have passed laws banning drivers from using hand-held mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>In response to growing public and political concern, many cellphone companies and motor vehicle manufacturers have taken steps to develop and expand the use of voice-activated technology. Previously heralded as a safer and less distracting method for drivers to communicate and interact with electronic devices, a new study shows that voice-activated devices are amongst the most distracting and dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>The study, which was conducted by the American Automobile Association, examined how drivers performed while engaging with a number of distracting devices while driving. Each distracting device was assigned a number from one to three based upon how dangerous and distracting it was deemed.<\/p>\n<p>The results of the study showed that drivers were most distracted when listening and responding to voice-activated devices. In fact, cellphone usage by drivers scored a two out of three while interacting with a voice-activation device scored a three or the highest and most distracting.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers at AAA who conducted the study hope the results will be helpful in convincing both cellphone and motor vehicle manufacturers of potential dangers associated with voice-activation technology. Each year, thousands of drivers and passengers are involved and killed in car accidents caused by distracted drivers. It&#8217;s important, therefore, that serious steps be taken to reduce the use of technologies that prove to be distracting to drivers.<\/p>\n<p>Source: WFMJ, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wfmj.com\/story\/22577136\/aaa-released-study-hands-free-technology-proves-equally-distracting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AAA released study, hands-free technology proves equally distracting<\/a>,&#8221; Chelsea Telega, June 12, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s against the law to text and drive in Ohio.
