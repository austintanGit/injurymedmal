The crash happened just before 11 p.m. on Dec. 6. According to reports, a 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier driven by an 18-year-old Waverly woman was struck by a 1997 Ford Escort driven by a 39-year-old Chillicothe man. The man had apparently run a red light, and the force of the collision pushed the 18-year-old&#8217;s vehicle into the southbound lanes of U.S. Route 23. Two women, ages 34 and 36, stopped to help the young woman push her car off the roadway and were seriously injured when another car struck all three. Reportedly, the 39-year-old Chillicothe man fled the scene.<\/p>\n<p>The good Samaritans were transported to Adena Medical Center and later transferred to Grant Medical Center in Franklin County. Sadly, doctors amputated both legs of the 36-year-old woman, and she was also facing multiple surgeries. No further word was available concerning the other injured women, except to say they are expected to survive the tragic accident. Authorities are presumably looking for the 39-year-old Chillicothe man who caused the first accident. At the time of reports, there was no indication if police planned to cite the second driver whose vehicle struck the three women.<\/p>\n<p>Each of the three injured women would appear to have legal basis for personal injury civil suits under Ohio law. The law permits individuals seriously injured due to the negligent or reckless conduct of another to recover monetary damages for their injuries, as well as for pain and suffering that may have resulted from an accident. Representatives for each party will likely investigate all of the facts and circumstances in an effort to help preserve evidence and assess legal responsibility for the injuries.<\/p>\n<p>Source: nbc4i.com, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www2.nbc4i.com\/news\/2011\/dec\/07\/3\/good-samaritans-hit-car-while-helping-crash-victim-ar-855141\" target=\"_blank\">Good Samaritans Hit By Car While Helping Crash Victim<\/a>,&#8221; Andy Long and Tom Brockman, Dec. 7, 2011<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sadly, two good Samaritans from Ohio were seriously injured recently after trying to help a woman who had been involved in a car accident.
