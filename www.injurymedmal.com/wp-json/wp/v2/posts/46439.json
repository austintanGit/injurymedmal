However, some people with an Alzheimer&#8217;s diagnosis may actually have a different form of dementia. Scientists say that the search for a cure is not affected by the discovery, but it is important to understand the differences between the two in order to learn more about how and why people develop dementia.<\/p>\n<p>Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#8217;s, lead to a gradual inability to handle tasks and loss of mental acuity and fitness. Most people who are diagnosed with dementia are considered to be Alzheimer&#8217;s patients. However, according to one study, thousands of people are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beingpatient.com\/late-dementia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">misdiagnosed<\/a> with Alzheimer&#8217;s who are actually suffering from different forms of dementia. As a result, they may receive inappropriate medications or ineffective treatments designed to combat amyloid plaques, proteins that form in the brain and kill neurons for patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s. While these plaques can be detected with a PET scan, they cost thousands of dollars and most insurance companies do not cover the scans, especially as there is still no cure for Alzheimer&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p>The other type of dementia discovered by scientists is not linked to amyloid plaques. Instead, a protein called TDP-43 builds up deposits in the brain. Other problems with this protein are linked to degenerative diseases, including ALS, otherwise known as Lou Gehrig&#8217;s Disease. Around 25 percent of elderly adults over 85 have enough problems with TDP-43 in their brains to cause some level of cognitive distortion and impairment.<\/p>\n<p>While there is no cure yet for dementia, misdiagnosis is common for a range of patients and can lead to a severely worsened health condition. People who have seen their disease progress due to a doctor&#8217;s error might opt to consult with <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">Columbus, Ohio, medical malpractice injury lawyers<\/a> about their options to take legal action and seek compensation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alzheimer&#8217;s can be a devastating illness for patients in Ohio and their families.
