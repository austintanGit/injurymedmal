However, they may find that goal hard to achieve. In the wake of daylight saving time, it becomes even more difficult. This is why the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety is recommending everyone to adjust their sleeping schedules. <\/p>\n<p>Drowsy driving is a major issue. A recent AAA survey showed that 95 percent of respondents understood the dangers involved. However, 30 percent of respondents to that same survey said that there was at least one time in the past month when they drove while having <a href=\"https:\/\/wdef.com\/2019\/03\/08\/daylight-saving-time-can-heighten-car-crash-risk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trouble keeping their eyes open<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>According to AAA, missing one to two hours of rest within a 24-hour period can roughly double the risk for a car crash. Driving after only five hours of sleep in that same period is like driving drunk. <\/p>\n<p>Sleep is the sole antidote for drowsiness. While there are short-term tactics for fending it off, such as opening the window, listening to music and drinking caffeinated beverages, the body will eventually win out over the mind. AAA reminds drivers to watch for the warning signs of drowsiness, which include drooping eyelids, constant yawning, trouble staying in a lane and the inability to remember the last few miles or exits. <\/p>\n<p>Someone who suffers <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">auto accident injuries<\/a> at the hands of a drowsy driver should know that they will be eligible to recover damages even if they are partially to blame. Recovery is not guaranteed, of course, and auto insurance companies can be aggressive in denying payment. Therefore, the victim may want a lawyer to assess their case. The lawyer may assist with the filing of the claim, the negotiations and the litigation process. If successful, the victim may be covered for medical bills, lost wages, vehicle repairs and more. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ohio residents may be aware that it&#8217;s wise to get at least seven hours of rest each night.
