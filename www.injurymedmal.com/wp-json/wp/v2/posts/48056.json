Well, imagine if your car somehow got stuck on the train tracks at one of those old train crossings that have neither lights nor gates. Now imagine that you are deaf, and your car has been bumped onto the tracks by a careless driver from behind. There is no time to react, no hope of getting out of the car, and no hope of avoiding a serious <a title=\"personal injury\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Other-Practice-Areas\/Catastrophic-Injuries\/\" target=\"_blank\">personal injury<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The exact scenario may have been the case for a Columbus man who was hospitalized after being struck by a train on Fisher Road near McKinley Avenue on July 15. The train struck the car on its side, in a T-bone fashion, and pushed it nearly 300 feet. There has been some speculation that the man&#8217;s car ended up on the tracks because it was hit from behind by another driver; however, police state they now intend to cite the driver involved in the accident, who happens to be deaf. And though he was hospitalized, initial reports indicated the man&#8217;s injuries were not life-threatening.<\/p>\n<p>While it appears the deaf driver may have stared down a train and survived, others involved in railroad crossing accidents don&#8217;t fare as well. In and around Columbus there are a number of railroad crossings, so the utmost care should be taken while driving. When an accident does occur, a combination of circumstances can be involved, including an insufficient number of safety devices or warnings of an oncoming train. While the man involved in this particular accident appears to have avoided serious injury, others involved in similar situations have ended up in critical condition &#8211; or in the worst cases, have lost their lives. Train accident victims and their families may benefit from the help of an experienced lawyer with knowledge of legal proceedings as they pertain to personal injury.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> NBC4i, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www2.nbc4i.com\/news\/2011\/jul\/15\/8\/car-hit-train-driver-minor-injuries-ar-613997\" target=\"_blank\">Driver To Be Cited After Car Hit By Train<\/a>,&#8221; Jason Mays, July 15, 2011.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many people remember the old movies where a young damsel in distress ends up tied to the railroad tracks with only moments to spare before the onrushing train crushes her.
