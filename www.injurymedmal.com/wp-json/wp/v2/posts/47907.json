The study addresses how some children who have experienced a concussion will continue to struggle with their recovery for many months.<\/p>\n<p>Children who experienced delayed recovery exhibited continued concussion symptoms for up to 12 months after the occurrence of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Other-Practice-Areas\/Catastrophic-Injuries\/\" target=\"_blank\">head injury<\/a>. Although the number of delayed-recovery cases was small, parents in Ohio will agree that any delay in recovery is significant. There are, of course, children who recover at a normal pace, but parents who have concerns about their child&#8217;s rate of recovery will want to be certain that all of the rehabilitation options are considered.<\/p>\n<p>Traumatic brain injuries and concussions in children can be caused by an array of factors. For instance, the most common cause of sports-related concussions in young girls is soccer. As is to be expected, another activity that is high on the concussion-causing list is football. Car accidents are also a very common cause of traumatic brain injuries.<\/p>\n<p>According to one hospital, the average amount of time that children take to recover from a concussion is six weeks. However, that relatively short span is dependent upon what therapists refer to as a period of &#8220;cognitive rest.&#8221; This means that the children are not allowed to partake in sports or school.<\/p>\n<p>Medical experts say that if children do not receive this period of rest after a brain injury, they are more likely to experience prolonged symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, children who have sustained one concussion are at a greater risk for suffering a second concussion. Therefore, therapists say it is important to be very cautious when putting children back into sports and other activities after an initial head injury. It is essential to allow plenty of time for children&#8217;s bodies to heal; allowing such time can help reduce the risk of subsequent concussions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source: <\/strong>The News Journal, &#8220;Study: Concussion symptoms in kids linger,&#8221; April 16, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ohio parents with children who have suffered from a traumatic brain injury may be interested in a recent study discussed in the Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine.
