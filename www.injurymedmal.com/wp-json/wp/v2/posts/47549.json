In one notable case, a professor at Boston&#8217;s Berklee College of Music contracted the disease after suffering a tick bite in Spain. He later reported to &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; that after two days, he exhibited multiple telltale symptoms of Lyme disease, including a bull&#8217;s-eye-shaped rash, fever, respiratory irritation and headaches.<\/p>\n<p>Although the man presented a number of characteristic symptoms, he was not treated properly until 10 months after he had become infected. News sources speculate that this <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">failure to diagnose<\/a> was related to the fact that U.S. doctors only test for infection caused by a single tick species; Lyme disease can be transmitted by other species, and the man eventually had to travel back to Europe for a specific test. Even after he received this confirmation, however, his U.S. doctor refused him antibiotics, claiming that the results were unreliable. <\/p>\n<p>At one point, the professor was incorrectly administered a solution of silver; this caused him to suffer multiple organ failures. Reports say that almost 300,000 individuals contract Lyme disease each year and that handling guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are heavily criticized. The issue may be further confused by the fact that under federal rules, many U.S. labs don&#8217;t even have to prove the efficacy of their Lyme disease tests. <\/p>\n<p>Individuals who contract serious diseases yet fail to be diagnosed properly may suffer other medical problems as a result. Incorrect treatment regimens can lead to heightened corrective care expenses and prolonged hospital stays. Medical malpractice lawsuits may be advisable for those who wish to offset their treatment costs. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>Medical Daily , &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.medicaldaily.com\/mans-10-month-lyme-disease-stint-exposes-holes-confusion-treating-it-us-291944\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Man&#8217;s 10-Month Lyme Disease Stint Exposes Holes, Confusion With Treating It In The US<\/a>&#8220;, Anthony Rivas, July 08, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lyme disease sufferers in Ohio and other states may be interested to learn that the way the disease has been dealt with in the U.S. may be problematic at a national level.
