A 60-year-old woman had reportedly stopped in the southbound lane of Ohio 60 to make a left-hand turn. Her Chevy Cavalier was rear-ended by a Dodge Intrepid, which was driven by a man from Lowell. The collision pushed the woman&#8217;s vehicle into the northbound lane, where it struck a Pontiac Grand Prix. The 60-year-old woman and her 37-year-old passenger were both seriously <a title=\"injured\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Other-Practice-Areas\/Catastrophic-Injuries\/\" target=\"_blank\">injured<\/a> and were air-lifted to different hospitals in Ohio and West Virginia, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Although the precise extent of the injuries sustained had not yet been determined, the passenger was reported to be in critical condition. While the families and loved ones of both victims will now hope for a quick recovery, they will also want to know exactly what occurred. Personal injury law in the state of Ohio mandates that those injured in a motor vehicle accident due to the negligence of another are entitled to seek monetary compensation for medical bills and lost wages, as well as for related pain and suffering. Clearly the injured passenger, and most likely the driver, has a legal basis for a claim to receive financial remuneration for their suffering.<\/p>\n<p>Residents in Columbus and throughout the state are often confused by the complexity of laws and regulations governing these types of matters. However, accident victims do have a right to answers regarding their particular situations. While money certainly can&#8217;t erase all of the problems that can result from a serious auto accident, some alleviation can come if high medical bills or lost wages are taken care of as a result of people knowing how to properly assert their rights in a court of law.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> Marietta Times, &#8220;4 hurt in 3-car Ohio 60 wreck,&#8221; Sam Shawver, Nov. 3, 2011<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Columbus readers may be interested in the story of a car accident involving three vehicles that collided at 9:30 a.m. on Nov. 2 in southeastern Ohio.
