They&#8217;ll then transport you to a local hospital for more advanced treatment.<\/p>\n<p>Your medical team is likely to order two tests:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CT scan:<\/strong> If you have a suspected brain injury, a CT scan is used to pinpoint fractures, bruises, bleeding and blood clots.<\/li>\n<li><strong>MRI:<\/strong> While a CT scan is typically ordered first, your doctor may request an MRI for a more detailed view of the brain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>What type of treatment is best?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The type of treatment you receive for a traumatic brain injury depends largely on the severity. Here are some things to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Emergency care:<\/strong> Regardless of the type of injury, emergency care is a must. This is all about maintaining an adequate blood supply, maintaining blood pressure and ensuring that you&#8217;re getting enough oxygen. If these things aren&#8217;t done in a timely manner, additional damage is more likely.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mild injury:<\/strong> For example, a concussion is considered a mild brain injury. It typically requires rest and pain medication to make a full recovery. However, it&#8217;s important to note that a mild injury can take a turn for the worse, so proper monitoring of symptoms is a must.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Severe traumatic brain injury:<\/strong> This can include everything from bleeding on the brain to a skull fracture. Once your doctors pinpoint your specific injuries, they&#8217;ll implement a treatment plan to give you the best chance of making a recovery. For example, a skull fracture may require immediate surgery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you suffer a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">traumatic brain injury in a car accident<\/a>, don&#8217;t wait to call 911.
