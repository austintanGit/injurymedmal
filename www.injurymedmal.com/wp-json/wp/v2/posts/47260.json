Patients who are injured by medical malpractice in nursing can seek compensation just like a patient who is injured because of a doctor&#8217;s medical malpractice.<\/p>\n<p>What are the elements of medical malpractice in nursing?<\/p>\n<p>There are four elements for medical malpractice in nursing. The first is that the nurse had to have a duty to provide medical care to the patient. The second is that the <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">nurse failed to provide the care the patient required<\/a>. The third is that the patient suffered damages because of the actions of the nurse. The fourth is that there is a direct relationship between the nurse&#8217;s actions and the damages the patient suffered. All four of these elements must be present in order for a medical malpractice case involving a nurse to move forward.<\/p>\n<p>How do I know if I received substandard care?<\/p>\n<p>Nurses must provide care that meets the expectations set forth by the standard of care. That standard of care is set by organizational procedures and policies. These policies and procedures are the absolute minimal care requirements that the nurse must meet in order to be considered to have provided the patient with care that lives up to the standard of care requirement. The requirements of regulatory bodies, including The Joint Commission and the centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, are also considered when determining the standard of care in each case.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> NurseTogether.com, &#8220;The 4 Elements of Medical Malpractice in Nursing,&#8221; Katie Morales, accessed April 28, 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Medical malpractice is a term that is usually associated with doctors; however, it is a term that can also be used when referring to nurses who don&#8217;t provide patients with adequate medical care.
