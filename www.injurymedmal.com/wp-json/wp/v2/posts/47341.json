When the injured person is a child, there are some very different factors to consider that can often lead to different effects because the child&#8217;s brain is still developing. This is true even if the child who is injured is a teenager.<\/p>\n<p>What is the recovery like for a child with a brain injury?<\/p>\n<p>The recovery for a child can be very difficult and often complex. The child&#8217;s brain continues to develop, but the development can be altered because of the brain injury. That often makes it difficult for the child to overcome the cognitive impacts. In the past, it was thought that a child&#8217;s brain was able to recover easier than an adult&#8217;s; however, it is now known that the impacts of the injury might not be apparent until later in the child&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>How does a brain injury affect education?<\/p>\n<p>Education is affected in a variety of ways for a child with a brain injury.
