Seat belts were not worn by either of the men at the time of the crash, and there were no passengers in either vehicle. The fatal accident resulted in Ohio 51 being shut down for over three hours while the wreckage was cleared from the roadway. <\/p>\n<p>The fatal <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a> took place in Clay Township at around 2 p.m. A 65-year-old man going southbound in a grey 2014 Dodge Challenger tried to pass a car in front of him by moving into the northbound lane. After crossing the centerline, the driver collided head-on with a silver 2006 Hyundai Elantra driven by an 84-year-old man. <\/p>\n<p>The impact of the crash caused the Dodge to travel westbound and overturn, ejecting the driver. According to information gathered in a preliminary investigation, OSHP troopers say they suspect the driver of the Dodge was intoxicated before the crash. In addition to OSHP troopers, paramedics and Allen-Clay Joint Fire District workers reported to the scene of the accident. <\/p>\n<p>Family members of a deceased car accident victim could choose to file a civil claim for compensation against the driver who was responsible for their loved one&#8217;s death. If the liable driver is deceased, the victim&#8217;s family can still pursue a wrongful death claim against the driver&#8217;s estate. An attorney may be able to help a family in this situation by handling the tasks of gathering evidence from the crash scene and calculating the financial damages incurred by the loss. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>News Herald, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.portclintonnewsherald.com\/story\/news\/local\/2014\/12\/16\/two-killed-rollover-accident-ohio\/20498805\/\" target=\"_blank\">Two men killed in Ohio 51 rollover crash<\/a>&#8220;, Jessica L Denton, December 17, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ohio State Highway Patrol say two drivers were pronounced dead at the scene of a two-car accident on Dec. 16.
