According to the president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), it is imperative that the automotive industry do whatever it can to make sure that drunk drivers cannot operate motor vehicles. A combination of state and federal funds is currently helping to spur the development of the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety.<\/p>\n<p>It can detect alcohol in a person&#8217;s breath and won&#8217;t allow the car to start if an individual has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autonews.com\/commentary\/devote-more-rd-prevent-drunken-driving\" target=\"_blank\">blood alcohol content<\/a> of .08% or higher. A touch-based system could be available at a later date according to an individual who is helping to run the program. The breath-based system is currently being tested and could be available for wider release at some point in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to government research programs, Volvo has said that it wants to install sensors and cameras in its vehicles to prevent drunk driving. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said that a system to stop drunk drivers from starting their vehicles could save up to 7,000 lives per year. The NHTSA says that drunk drives accounted for 29% of traffic fatalities in 2017, so keeping drunk drivers off of the road could make highways significantly safer.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals who have been in a motor vehicle accident may consider hiring <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">Columbus, Ohio, fatal motor vehicle accident legal representation<\/a>. Doing so may help to preserve their rights and make it easier to obtain compensation for medical bills and other costs related to the accident. These costs might include lost wages, lost future earnings and money spent replacing property lost or damaged in a crash. An injured victim may choose to settle a case without taking it to trial.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There were more than 200,000 injuries caused by drunk drivers in Ohio and throughout the country in 2017.
