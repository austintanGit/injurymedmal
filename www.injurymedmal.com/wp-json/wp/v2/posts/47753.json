However, when a car accident results in the unexpected death of one or more people, it can have a life-changing impact on the family of the deceased. In addition to the emotional hardship, a fatal car wreck will likely give rise to new and unexpected financial obligations.<\/p>\n<p>When a death was caused by the negligence of another party, the family may be able to recover compensation to help them with some of these newly arising hardships by filing a <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrongful death<\/a> lawsuit against the negligent party. The survivors of an Ohio woman have recently decided to take this very action.<\/p>\n<p>The 19-year-old woman was killed in an accident that occurred in 2011 in Ellsworth Township. She was driving west when a man traveling north in a pickup truck struck her vehicle. The lawsuit claims that the man negligently caused the accident and, therefore, the young woman&#8217;s death and is asking for compensation exceeding $25,000.<\/p>\n<p>Drivers who travel on the roads of Ohio are expected to exercise a certain reasonable amount of care while operating their motorized vehicle. It is when their actions fall below this required standard of care that they are considered negligent. There are a wide variety of behaviors that would make a driver negligent including speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, not yielding to traffic signs or lights, distracted driving and much more.<\/p>\n<p>Situations like this are very difficult for the survivors of the individual that was killed in the accident. It is so important that the person responsible for the accident is held responsible for their negligent actions. Although no amount of money will ever bring back a loved one, it still helps to relieve some of the unexpected financial pain that arises after a tragic fatal wreck such as this one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source: <\/strong>Vindy.com, &#8220;Wrongful-death lawsuit filed in 2011 Ellsworth Twp. crash,&#8221; March 4, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Car accidents can always have potentially tragic results.
