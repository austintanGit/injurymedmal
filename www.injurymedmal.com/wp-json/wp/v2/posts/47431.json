According to authorities, the accident occurred after a vehicle driving on Interstate 70 crossed three lanes of traffic and hit a motorcycle. Both vehicles were traveling eastbound when the crash took place, and the victim was a 58-year-old woman. Authorities say that an anonymous tip led gave them the lead that eventually led to a confession.<\/p>\n<p>The tip reportedly involved an employee at a company saying that his daughter had gotten away with the crime and that the vehicle had been chopped and burnt. After talking to police, the man admitted that his daughter had been the driver who caused the crash. The woman then talked to police and admitted that she had been the driver who caused the collision.<\/p>\n<p>Family members of those who are killed in a fatal car accident may decide to take legal action against the driver who caused the collision. It may be possible to obtain compensation from the driver in the form of punitive damages as well as money to pay for the victim&#8217;s final expenses. Compensation may also be made available to help pay for any future lost earnings due to the victim&#8217;s wrongful death.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who is planning to take legal action after a wrongful death in a car crash may wish to consult with a personal injury attorney. An attorney may be able to review the case and help negotiate a settlement outside of court or represent the family during a trial. Generally, a case may be settled faster when done outside of court, which may allow the family to obtain closure and start the healing process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> NBC4i, &#8220;Police: Woman Admits To Pickerington Fatal Hit-Skip,&#8221; Joe Clark, March 10, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A 24-year-old woman admitted to police that she was the driver in a fatal accident that took place during July 2014.
