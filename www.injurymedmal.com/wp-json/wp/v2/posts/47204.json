Medication errors can include prescribing an incorrect dosage, filling an incorrect dosage or administering an incorrect dosage of a medication. Failing to verify that there aren&#8217;t any drug interactions between medications is another example of a medication error. These errors can be the fault of doctors, pharmacists or nurses.<\/p>\n<p>What is an adverse event?<\/p>\n<p>An adverse event is something that occurs because of different reasons, including a <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">medication error<\/a>. These events fall into different categories, including preventable, potential and non-preventable. Non preventable adverse reactions, which are also known as side effects are one example of an adverse event that isn&#8217;t caused by a medication error.
