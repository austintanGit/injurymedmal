The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">car accident<\/a>, which involved a car and a tractor-trailer, happened in the northern part of the state around 3 a.m. on Interstate 75. The two men in the car were killed, and the driver of the semi suffered injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities are unsure whether the driver of the car was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash. Police were also uncertain of how the man ended up traveling in the wrong direction or where he entered the roadway.<\/p>\n<p>The driver of tractor-trailer was taken to a hospital for treatment. The nature of his injuries was not disclosed in a local news report. It would appear that he has grounds for a personal injury claim.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly before the accident, another semi nearly collided head-on with the wrong-way vehicle but was able to avoid an accident. However, the driver of the second semi was not so lucky.<\/p>\n<p>The previous two wrong-way accidents in the Toledo area left four individuals dead and two others injured.<\/p>\n<p>Up until recently, Ohio has not kept track of statistics involving crashes specifically caused by wrong-way drivers. However, because of the recent collisions, car accident reports in Ohio will include such information starting this year. By 2013, all Ohio agencies are expected to compile statistics involving wrong-way crashes.<\/p>\n<p>As readers in the Columbus area know, victims of car accidents often endure numerous physical, financial and emotional burdens. In addition to their struggle to recover, many victims seek to obtain compensation for their injuries. When medical bills and other expenses pile up and pain and suffering seems unshakable, compensation for injuries can offer some measure of solace to victims who are doing their best to get their lives back together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source: <\/strong>Detroit Free Press, &#8220;2 Michigan men killed after wrong-way crash in Ohio,&#8221; JoAnne Viviano, March 13, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the third wrong-way collision in recent weeks, two men lost their lives in Ohio.
