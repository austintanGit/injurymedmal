That same technology is now being deployed in nursing homes around Ohio in an effort to make sure that people aren&#8217;t stealing from nursing home residents. The Ohio Health Care Association notes that it isn&#8217;t against these cameras as long as proper consent is obtained and privacy of other residents is maintained.<\/p>\n<p>The Attorney General notes that granny cams can give you information that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to get any other way. These cameras have been helpful in stopping cases of theft from nursing home residents.<\/p>\n<p>When you think about it, any theft from a nursing home resident is horrible. When that theft is being done by employees who are supposed to care for the residents, that is even worse. Many <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/nursing-home-abuse-negligence\/\">nursing home residents<\/a> get only a very small, sometimes as little as $50, allowance each month. With that in mind, you can see how even a small theft can have a huge impact.<\/p>\n<p>The granny cams at Ohio nursing homes have had some interesting footage. One employee was caught stealing gift cards from a resident. Another case involved the theft of a resident&#8217;s wedding set. Another employee was stealing cash from residents.<\/p>\n<p>These granny cams aren&#8217;t limited only to catching thefts. These cameras can also catch instances of nursing home abuse and nursing home neglect. Anyone who has a loved one in a nursing home might consider looking into the possibility of a granny cam to help keep his or her loved one safe.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> WBNS 10, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.10tv.com\/content\/stories\/2015\/07\/20\/granny-cams-catching-nursing-homes-thieves-in-the-act.html\" target=\"_blank\">&lsquo;Granny Cams&rsquo; Catching Nursing Homes Thieves In The Act<\/a>,&#8221; Jerry Revish, July 20, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nanny cams are a great way for parents to keep an eye on their children while they sleep or while a babysitter is watching over the children.
