Distracted driving is an increasingly serious problem in Ohio and throughout the country. Cell phone use and other means of distraction cause harm to life and limb on a daily basis. A recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/Fatal-Car-Accidents.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">fatal accident<\/a> in Columbus is still under investigation, but it would appear that one of the drivers will be found at fault for the crash.<\/p>\n<p>According to reports, a car driven by a 25-year-old Columbus woman turned in front of a motorcycle coming in the opposite direction. The two vehicles collided, and the 31-year-old driver of the motorcycle suffered&nbsp;catastrophic injuries. He was transported to Riverside Methodist Hospital in critical condition. Sadly, though, he was pronounced dead about 40 minutes after the initial collision.<\/p>\n<p>The driver of the car was apparently not hurt, and it was indicated that the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.<\/p>\n<p>The crash happened on May 28 at about 10:30 p.m. That means each vehicle&#8217;s lights, and whether they were on or working properly, could be a factor to be considered in the police investigation. Speed is also a typical consideration when authorities reconstruct an accident. Other points of inquiry would be whether either driver was intoxicated or otherwise distracted prior to the collision.<\/p>\n<p>After the Columbus Police Department concludes the investigation, fault will likely be assigned to one of the drivers. If fault lies with the woman who turned in front of the motorcycle, the family of the deceased man will in all likelihood have the basis for a wrongful death claim.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> nbc4i.com, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www2.nbc4i.com\/news\/2012\/may\/29\/motorcyclist-killed-karl-road-crash-identified-ar-1052971\/\" target=\"_blank\">Motorcyclist Killed In Karl Road Crash Is Identified<\/a>,&#8221; Donna Willis, May 29, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It should be clear to all motorists: failing to exercise due caution on the road can have catastrophic consequences.
