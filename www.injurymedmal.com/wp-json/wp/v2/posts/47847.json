However, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">car accidents<\/a> involving a motorcycle are more likely to have tragic results due to the variance in size between the vehicles. Often times the motorcyclist will face much more severe injuries than the driver of the car.<\/p>\n<p>A recent car crash in Ohio involving a car and a motorcycle has left the motorcyclist in critical condition. The motorcycle was driving south on Ohio 4. Another vehicle that was traveling east pulled away from a stop sign and into the path of the motorcyclist, causing a collision. According to accident reports, the motorcyclist had the right of way and the driver of the car had a stop sign. Charges have not yet been filed.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to a traffic fine, the car driver could also be facing a personal injury lawsuit. When a car accident is caused by one party&#8217;s negligence or lack of care and it results in injuries to another party, the injured party is able to recover compensation from the negligent driver.<\/p>\n<p>The compensation will help the injured party cover expenses that arise as a result of the accident. These may include, but are not limited to, medical treatment and personal property damage. <a><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are many steps that must be taken before this compensation can be recovered. Some of these steps include analyzing the accident reports, gathering medical bills, speaking with insurance companies and much more. These are tasks best handled by an experienced personal injury attorney.<\/p>\n<p>The sooner the lawsuit is filed, the sooner the injured party will receive the needed compensation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source: <\/strong>whiotv.com, &#8220;Motorcyclist in wreck on Ohio 4 still critical,&#8221; Sept. 12, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accidents that result in injuries to one or more of the parties involved are always unfortunate.
