The accident resulted in the northbound side of the highway being shut down for about an hour and a half. According to the Ohio Highway Patrol, it does not appear that drug or alcohol use was a factor in the collision. Everyone involved in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">car accident<\/a> had been wearing a seat belt. <\/p>\n<p>Shortly before 1 p.m., a 38-year-old Vicksburg, Michigan, man was traveling northbound in the left center lane in a Subaru Outback. When he attempted to move to the right center lane, his vehicle struck the back of a Toyota Avalon driven by a 78-year-old Franklin woman. The Avalon came to an abrupt stop, causing an approaching freightliner semi-truck to veer to the left. Unable to avoid the collision, the 38-year-old Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, driver of the semi-truck hit both the Outback and the Avalon. <\/p>\n<p>Following the accident, Liberty Township EMS removed the elderly driver from her vehicle. She was transported to Atrium Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries. The other two drivers did not sustain any injuries. A citation for assured clear distance was issued to the Outback driver. <\/p>\n<p>Although her injuries were not life-threatening, the elderly driver may have experienced a great deal of pain and trauma from the accident. If she wishes to seek compensation for her injuries, a lawyer may be able to help her file the proper paperwork and present her case to a judge. Compensation might cover her medical bills in addition to the pain and suffering that she may have endured. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>FOX 19, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fox19.com\/story\/23669317\/three-vehicle-crash-near-monroe-closes-nb-i-75-on-friday\" target=\"_blank\">I-75 reopens after 3-vehicle crash near Monroe<\/a>&#8220;, October 11, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An elderly woman was injured in a three-vehicle crash on Interstate 75 just south of Monroe on Oct. 11.
