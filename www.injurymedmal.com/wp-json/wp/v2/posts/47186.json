While there are those who drive safely for years to come, it is a fact that teen drivers are the highest risk group out there. In fact, 16-year-old drivers crash at a higher rate than any other age.<\/p>\n<p>Some of this could be due to distracted driving. When asked, more than half of all teens said they would talk on their cellphones while behind the wheel.<\/p>\n<p>It could also be due to having their friends in the car. A study looked at the fatality rates of 16-year old drivers and 17-year-old drivers, and it found that the odds of a deadly accident rose for every passenger added to the car. A teen driving by himself or herself is still a high risk, but a teen driving with a car packed with friends is even worse.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, a third of all of those between the ages of 13 and 19 who died were killed in car accidents. This makes it one of the leading causes of death by far.<\/p>\n<p>Teens may also fail to hold each other accountable. One study asked teens what they&#8217;d do if they were riding with another teen who was driving dangerously or recklessly. The majority said they would keep quiet, with just 44 percent saying they&#8217;d definitely say anything or ask the driver to behave in a safe manner.<\/p>\n<p>Have you been injured in an accident caused by a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/\">teen driver<\/a>? As you can see, this is quite common, and you must know how to get proper compensation.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> Do Something, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dosomething.org\/us\/facts\/11-facts-about-teen-driving\" target=\"_blank\">11 Facts about Teen Driving<\/a>,&#8221; accessed Oct. 20, 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For most teens, turning 16 is terrific because it means they finally get to drive on their own.
