Police are investigating whether or not the driver was texting after she allegedly admitted to looking down at her phone at the time of the accident. <\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a> happened at the intersection of Fosdick and Canal Road. The four motorcycles were stopped at the red traffic light at the intersection when a minivan ran into them from behind. Police did not find any evidence that the female driver attempted to slow down or evade the motorcycles. <\/p>\n<p>A total of seven people were riding the motorcycles, and all of them suffered injuries. One of the cyclists suffered serious injuries, including a fractured skull and brain bleeding. Authorities did not say whether they were wearing helmets or other safety gear. Although alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the crash, the minivan driver could face felony charges in connection with the accident after investigators analyze the texting records on her cellphone. Reports did not indicate whether she was injured during the accident. <\/p>\n<p>The seven victims injured in the May collision could be eligible for compensation if the minivan driver is found at fault due to a lack of reasonable care. The compensation may help them recover the cost of their medical treatment and the loss of income. A successful personal injury lawsuit against the liable party may also help with future surgeries and any long-term care required as a direct result of the accident.<\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>WAFB, &#8220;Distracted driver hits four motorcycles&#8221;, May 27, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An Ohio driver may have been distracted by her phone when she hit four motorcycles in early May.
