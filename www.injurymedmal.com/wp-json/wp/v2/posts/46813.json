Nevertheless, they must follow all the rules of the road and refrain from operating scooters while intoxicated.<\/p>\n<p>Some community members, however, question whether the current laws are enough. Do electric scooters travel too quickly to be used on sidewalks? Should age requirements apply to the use of electric scooters? Should helmet laws apply to scooter users?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The rise of scooter share services in Columbus<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>City officials may need to answer the above questions soon &#8212; especially in light of new &#8220;scooter share&#8221; services, which are making electric scooters more accessible in Columbus. Two companies, Bird and LimeBike, are offering cheap electric scooter rental services to community members in our city. Bird requires users to be at least 18, have a driver&#8217;s license and adhere to a list of safety instructions. It also offers free helmets for all users.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Columbus police, no serious injuries or fatalities have resulted from scooter crashes yet in the city.
