However, most people would assume that the injuries happen upon the initial impact and not afterward. That was not the case for a recent Ohio crash that left a man in critical condition.<\/p>\n<p>On July 16, a van struck a car in Clintonville. The driver of the car, a 25-year-old man, was not harmed in the initial crash. But when he exited his vehicle to inspect it, his car was struck from behind by another motorist. This impact pinned him between his car and the van.<\/p>\n<p>Paramedics arrived at the scene and had to extract the man from between the two vehicles. He then was transported to the hospital for medical treatment.<\/p>\n<p>Serious injuries in motor vehicle accidents can seem to occur based on the flip of a coin. Sometimes individuals walk away without a scratch, while other accidents may be fatal. Unfortunately for those who are injured, healing often isn&#8217;t the only struggle. There will be insurance companies to work with, medical bills to pay, accident reports to gather and much more. The process can quickly become stressful and overwhelming, and it is often helpful for accident victims to seek assistance with the process.<\/p>\n<p>An individual who has been injured because of another driver&#8217;s negligence may be entitled to compensation through filing a personal injury claim. This type of lawsuit will help the injured party cover some if not all of the expenses that arise as a result of an accident.<\/p>\n<p>It is important for Columbus residents who have been injured in a car accident to evaluate their options for recovery. Although compensation may not immediately or completely return an injured victim to his or her pre-accident standard of living, such payments can help victims better navigate the recovery process.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more about your rights as an accident victim, please visit our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ohio personal injury<\/a> site.
