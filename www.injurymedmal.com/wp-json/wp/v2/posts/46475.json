While there are a number of factors that can lead to crashes involving large trucks, truck driver fatigue poses a special concern. Long hours over monotonous stretches of highway, especially at night, are part of a truck driver&#8217;s job. Even following federal regulations on hours of service mean that a trucker spends many hours behind the wheel. Those regulations limit truck drivers to 11 hours of driving and a 14-hour total workday. <\/p>\n<p>In too many circumstances, truck drivers exceed those federal limits, contributing to a dangerous level of drowsiness.

Fatigue can be almost as deadly as drunkenness or distraction when it comes to driving, so it is particularly concerning that large truck accidents continue to rise across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Many industries rely on trucking for supplies, commerce and trade; in North Dakota, the oil industry is one such example. As a result, 67% of truck crashes in the state take place in the regions most heavily associated with the industry. Some of these truck accidents even occur on bypasses specifically constructed to enhance roadway safety by limiting the likelihood of a crash involving a semi-truck. In two deadly crashes, an 18-wheeler crossed the center line of the road and slammed head-on into another vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Truck accidents pose a major risk to others on the roadway, especially when fatigued or otherwise negligent driving is involved.
