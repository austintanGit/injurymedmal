The <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">wrongful death<\/a> suit claims that the topical medication set off a deep depression in their son that resulted in the taking of his own life. The teen&#8217;s parents are suing Allergan and AmerisourceBergen for punitive and compensatory damages for breach of warranty, fraud, improper marketing and misleading labeling.<\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit alleged that an adverse reaction to the chemical dapsone caused the 17-year-old&#8217;s depression and decision to commit suicide, which he arrived at during a high school football game. One week after that game, he shot himself, according to his parents. They alleged that the abnormal depressive moods caused by the acne treatment could have lasted for 10 days after that treatment was stopped. The teen killed himself 10 days after discontinuing use of Aczone.<\/p>\n<p>The complaint stated that severe adverse affects were noted during the controlled drug trials, so the problem would have been known to Allergen and AmerisourceBergen. They allege that the companies downplayed the severity of the psychiatric reactions, which could be done because there was apparently no scientific studies showing the psychosis and suicidal tendencies caused by the drug when it was approved by the FDA in 2005 or brought onto the market in 2008.<\/p>\n<p>Wrongful death due to an adverse drug reaction can devastate families. Families who have suffered the loss of a loved one may be able to sue for damages. A personal injury attorney may be able to help them put together a strong case for compensation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<\/strong>Courthouse News, &#8220;Family Says Acne Medication Caused Suicide&#8221;, Kevin Koeninger, January 20, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Parents of teenagers in Ohio and around the country might want to take notice of a lawsuit filed by the mother and father of a 17-year-old who committed suicide while having his acne treated with Aczone.
