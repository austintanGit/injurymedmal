The fatal crash happened on Aug. 18 on a highway in Plymouth Township. <\/p>\n<p>According to the report, around 3.p.m., a 24-year-old woman driving southbound in a sedan crashed into the northbound motorcycle after her car drifted left of center. The biker, a 65-year-old man, was fatally injured in the wreck. <\/p>\n<p> Fire and medical rescue personnel who arrived at the scene extricated the woman from her car. She was then airlifted to Grant Hospital in Columbus for treatment of unknown injuries. The motorcyclist was transported to Ohio Health Med Central in Shelby, where he succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead the same day as the crash, according to reports. <\/p>\n<p> The investigation into the crash was ongoing on the day of the incident. Police did not disclose if they planned on filing charges against the sedan driver. <\/p>\n<p> Oftentimes, motorcycle accidents are caused by a careless or reckless driver who makes sudden turns or drives too closely to the biker. If a car turns into the pathway of a motorcycle, the results of the crash could lead to catastrophic, life-threatening injuries for the biker, who has little to no protection on the roadway. Ohio residents who experience the loss of a loved one in a fatal motorcycle accident may be eligible to pursue compensation through a <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">wrongful death<\/a> claim filed in a civil court. If there is evidence from police reports or eyewitness accounts establishing any kind of driver negligence, the deceased victim&#8217;s family might be able to hold that driver liable for their accident-related losses. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>Norwalk Reflector, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.norwalkreflector.com\/article\/4840801\" target=\"_blank\">Fatal crash kills one in Plymouth Township<\/a>&#8220;, Aaron Krause, August 18, 2014<\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>Norwalk Reflector, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.norwalkreflector.com\/article\/4840801\" target=\"_blank\">Fatal crash kills one in Plymouth Township<\/a>&#8220;, Aaron Krause, August 18, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An accident involving a motorcycle and a car in Ohio took the life of the motorcyclist and injured the driver of the car.
