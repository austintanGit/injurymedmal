Nearly one-third of those questioned had operated a vehicle at least once while struggling to keep their eyes open.<\/p>\n<p>Adults need an average of seven hours of sleep every night. However, even those who get enough sleep may still feel tired. This is often because of prescription medications or health conditions. Drug interactions can cause drowsiness while muscle relaxers, antidepressants, blood pressure drugs and anxiety medications could also make one sleepy. To stay awake while driving, switching off with a partner or just having someone to talk to could help. A break may be needed every few hours, and napping could also be beneficial. However, one should not nap for longer than 20 minutes to avoid grogginess. One tried and true method for staying awake is caffeine. Methods that do not work well for wakefulness include turning the radio up and rolling the windows down or blasting the air conditioner for cold air.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">Car collisions<\/a> can cause catastrophic injuries to occupants of other vehicles that often require extensive and expensive medical treatment.
