Of course, if there is a bridge or a covered walkway the speed may be elevated and you won&#8217;t get a ticket for driving the normal speed limit in this zone.

Limits are governed by law, not by what the local authorities think should happen.<\/p>\n<p>Being aware of the law and knowing your rights is so important. Having someone in your corner when you have been in an accident that was not your fault is equally as important.
