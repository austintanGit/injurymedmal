The accident occurred on June 16 around 8 a.m., and Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers believe that the accident was caused by a 24-year-old female driver who lost control of her 2007 Chrysler and crossed the center line before hitting a 2012 Nissan Sentra.<\/p>\n<p>The crash ended up killing the 65-year-old male driver of the Sentra despite the fact that he was wearing a seatbelt. Troopers reported that the impact of the crash killed the man due to the &#8220;compartment intrusion.&#8221; The 24-year-old female driver was injured but was expected to recover.<\/p>\n<p>Troopers weren&#8217;t immediately certain what caused the woman to lose control of her vehicle, but they said that speed, weather and an oily substance were possible <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/fatal-car-accidents\/\">contributing factors<\/a>. A trooper reported that the speed limit on the road was 55 mph, but it was common for drivers to exceed that, and when speed is coupled with rainy conditions and the road&#8217;s curves, it can create a dangerous environment.<\/p>\n<p>In general, the faster a vehicle is moving before a crash, the more serious the crash is. However, it&#8217;s important to understand that even if both drivers were moving under the speed limit, it may still be too fast for road conditions. Posted speed limits are for ideal weather, road and visibility conditions, and any changes to this should mean corresponding changes to speed. If the at-fault driver did not make these adjustments, it could have a bearing on a personal injury lawsuit down the road.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> Dayton Daily News, &#8220;Fatal crash is 4th in 2 years on Old Columbus Road,&#8221; June 16, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A head-on crash in Ohio involving two vehicles has claimed the life of one person, and authorities say it is the fourth fatal accident on the road since May of 2014.
