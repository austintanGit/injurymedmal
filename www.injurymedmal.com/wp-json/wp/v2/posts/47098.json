The goal of the program is to develop &#8220;next-generation technologies that improve memory function in people who suffer from memory loss.&#8221; Their recent findings were published in Current Biology.<\/p>\n<p>The neuroscientists report that electrical stimulation can improve a person&#8217;s memory function when it is delivered when memory failure is predicted. When the electrical stimulation is delivered when a person&#8217;s memory is functioning properly, the stimulation is disruptive.<\/p>\n<p>The lead author said, &#8220;By applying machine-learning methods to electrical signals measured at widespread locations throughout the human brain, we are able to identify neural activity that indicates when a given patient will have lapses of memory encoding.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The study involved patients who suffer from epilepsy. They were asked to remember a list of common words while undergoing safe stimulation of the brain. They determined that when the stimulation occurs when the person&#8217;s memory is working properly, memory worsens. When the stimulation arrives when the memory is not functioning properly, memory improves.<\/p>\n<p>The neuroscientists believe that this process could help <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/traumatic-brain-injuries\/\">improve the lives of people who have suffered traumatic brain injuries<\/a> or who suffer from neurological disease like Alzheimer&#8217;s. However, there is more work needed to be able to develop an &#8220;actual therapeutic platform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Suffering from a traumatic brain injury can have drastic effects on a person&#8217;s life.
