Between 2005 and 2012, a new report claims, 772 tools were left in patients and 16 people died from the effects.<\/p>\n<p>The report, issued by the Joint Commission, criticizes hospitals for poor procedures and ineffective communication between members of a surgical team. In some cases protocols are not followed, and in other cases they simply do not exist. At other hospitals, insufficient education of staff was a problem as well. The Commission&#8217;s report suggested that hospitals adopt procedures such as having more than one person perform the instrument count and using a board with instrument counts on them. One hospital cut errors in half by using similar protocols.<\/p>\n<p>While these mistakes have their biggest impact on individuals and their families, they also cost hospitals a great deal of money. A recent lawsuit claimed that a sponge left inside a woman for four years caused her extreme pain, disability and mental distress. Courts awarded her $2.5 million.
