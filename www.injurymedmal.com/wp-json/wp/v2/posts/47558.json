In 2007, the woman had a hysterectomy performed at Simi Valley Hospital in Southern California. Three days later, she went back to the hospital complaining of pain, but medical providers told her she had a severe case of constipation. <\/p>\n<p>The woman says that among other symptoms, she experienced vaginal bleeding, nausea and abdominal pain following the hysterectomy. A year after the initial surgery, the woman almost fainted and again returned to the hospital, but she was only diagnosed with a gastrointestinal issue. In 2011, a gynecologist believed that an ovarian cyst might have been to blame for some of her symptoms. During the surgery to remove the suspected cyst, medical providers discovered a sponge, which was covered in scar tissue. In order to remove it, they had to take out a significant portion of her intestines. <\/p>\n<p>In 2012, the California Department of Public Health fined the hospital $25,000, and they also paid a penalty a few months later for leaving a clamp in another surgical patient. The hospital says they have more safety procedures in place now than they did at the time of the woman&#8217;s surgery. In the lawsuit, the woman has named both the hospital and medical staff involved in the surgery as defendants. <\/p>\n<p>In some cases, a physician or other medical staff may administer the wrong amount of anesthesia, use non-sterile equipment, puncture vital organs or make the incisions incorrectly. Following surgery, a doctor could also fail to diagnose or properly treat complications within a reasonable time frame. If a medical provider has made an error during a surgery, the patient may be able to file a <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">medical malpractice lawsuit<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>New York Daily News, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/national\/calif-woman-sues-hospital-forgotten-surgical-sponge-forces-removal-intestines-article-1.1834930\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">California woman sues hospital after forgotten surgical sponge forces removal of intestines <\/a>&#8220;, Deborah Hastings, June 18, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ohio patients may be interested to hear about a California woman who is suing a hospital after medical staff forgot to remove a surgical sponge during an operation.
