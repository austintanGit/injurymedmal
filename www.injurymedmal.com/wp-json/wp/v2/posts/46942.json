However, Ohio women who have to undergo the procedure may find it very time-consuming and not completely accurate, primarily because of human errors and the inefficiencies in current surgical technology. <\/p>\n<p>However, there is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.darkdaily.com\/3d-printed-robot-may-change-breast-biopsies-surgery-and-boost-accuracy-of-anatomic-pathology-cancer-diagnoses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3D robotic biopsy system<\/a> used in conjunction with an MRI scan that can transform how biopsies are conducted, and it may improve the accuracy of the procedure and breast cancer diagnoses. This new technology, which is currently being developed by researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, can affect medical laboratories and surgical pathology around the world. <\/p>\n<p>Referred to as Stormram 4, the robotic system would be able to excise biological tissues during an MRI scan, similar to how current biopsy procedures are conducted. However, unlike the manual procedure, the robotic system is able to provide sub-millimeter precision with a thin biopsy needle. <\/p>\n<p>The robotic system is composed of 3D-printed plastic that is maneuvered using specialized motors. The robot can fit inside of the narrow tunnel of an MRI scanner and can be operated when the scanner is in use. <\/p>\n<p>The MRI-guided breast biopsy that is performed manually may require multiple tries to obtain a large tissue samples. In contrast, the robotic system can maneuver the needle with a precision that reaches the target area inside the breast on the first try. The insertion of the needle can be executed inside the scanner so that the imaging guidance is occurring practically in real time. <\/p>\n<p> Columbus, Ohio, <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">medical malpractice injury lawyers<\/a> may be able to pursue financial compensation on behalf of clients whose health care professionals provided negligent medical care.
