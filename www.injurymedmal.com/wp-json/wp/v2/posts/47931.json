The 20-year-old who died was a passenger in a Ford Escort that moved into the intersection without properly heeding the stop sign. As the car crossed the intersection, a Jeep crashed into the driver&#8217;s side.<\/p>\n<p>All three individuals involved in the <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\" target=\"_blank\">fatal accident<\/a> were quickly transported to the hospital. The driver of the Jeep has since been released, and the driver of the Escort was still in the hospital in stable condition at the time of a local news report. The 20-year-old passenger was declared deceased on Jan. 31 at Grant Medical Center in Columbus.<\/p>\n<p>Fatal car accidents too often result from reckless or negligent behavior. In this case, the family of the deceased young man will likely have grounds to file a wrongful death claim to pursue some form of compensation for their devastating loss.<\/p>\n<p>If the family decides to pursue such an action, a number of steps must be accomplished. For example, a thorough investigation must be conducted to assess the precise circumstances of the accident. After the investigation, it may undoubtedly be determined who was at fault.<\/p>\n<p>A wrongful death lawsuit can result in an award of financial compensation to the decedent&#8217;s family. Such compensation can assist them with the financial and emotional struggles that result from the death of their loved one.<\/p>\n<p>The following are examples of&nbsp;damages for which families may be compensated:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grief<\/li>\n<li>Loss of love and emotional support<\/li>\n<li>Loss of guidance for children<\/li>\n<li>Loss of long-term financial assistance<\/li>\n<li>Loss of help maintaining a household<\/li>\n<li>Compensation for the decedent&#8217;s pain and suffering prior to death<\/li>\n<li>Funeral and medical bills<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although nothing can bring back a loved one who has passed away, a wrongful death suit may help prevent an emotional struggle from turning into a financial one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source: <\/strong>Marion Star, &#8220;Passenger dies from injuries after Jan. 21 crash,&#8221; Jan. 31, 2012<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sadly, a young Ohio man suffered fatal injuries in a recent car accident that resulted from a driver&#8217;s failing yield at a stop sign.
