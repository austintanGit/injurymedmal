Ohio residents are no different than others when it comes to that belief. But there are times when it seems that a car accident could have been prevented or avoided.<\/p>\n<p>One such incident took place on Oct. 19, when a 46-year-old man from Newark, Ohio, failed to yield at a stop sign and hit another vehicle. The car accident took place at the intersection of Hopewell Drive and Franklin Avenue in Heath, according to a news release issued by the Heath Police Department. The female driver of the other vehicle was given medical treatment and released from Licking Memorial Hospital. The man had to be transported to a Columbus medical facility. His condition is not known.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to police, the man was traveling northbound of Franklin Avenue at about 1:00 a.m. when he failed to yield at a stop sign. The female driver of the other vehicle was driving westbound on Hopewell Drive when she was hit. Police also report that alcohol is suspected to have played a role in the accident, which remains under investigation.<\/p>\n<p>In Ohio, as elsewhere, those who drive expect a certain degree of safety and careful driving from others who may also be on the road. When another driver causes injury due to negligent actions, the injured person has certain legal rights he or she may wish to pursue. In a case such as this, a lawsuit charging the negligent party with personal injury seeking monetary damages could be in the cards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> The Newark Advocate, &#8220;Heath crash sends 2 to hospitals,&#8221; Oct. 19, 2011<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Car accidents happen every day.
