Not every blow will result in a TBI. The most common type of TBI is a concussion, although the injury can be much more severe.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common cause of TBIs was falls. Forty-seven percent of visits to the emergency room (ER), hospital admissions and deaths related to TBIs are due to falls. The oldest and youngest age groups are the most affected by falls.<\/p>\n<p>Fifty-four percent of children 0 to 14 years old who were seen in the ER, hospitalized or died due to TBIs suffered the injury in a fall. For adults 65 and older, it is 79 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Being struck against or by an object is the second-most common cause of TBIs. Children who were under 15 years old accounted for 22 percent of ER visits, hospital admissions or deaths related to TBIs.<\/p>\n<p>Motor vehicle crashes came in as the third leading cause of deaths, hospitalizations or ER visits due to TBIs for all age groups. In 2013, the second leading cause of deaths related to TBIs was intentional self-harm.<\/p>\n<p>These statistics show how common TBIs can be and why fall prevention is so important.
