In many cases, family members are not financially or emotionally equipped to manage round-the-clock care of an ailing parent or grandparent. Physical and mental ailments often necessitate assistance with everyday tasks and personal care matters. What&#8217;s more, many elderly Americans require supervision to ensure prescription medications are taken and fall accidents do not occur.<\/p>\n<p>For many families, nursing homes provide the promise of a much-needed safe haven for a loved one. While many nursing homes do indeed provide exemplary care, others engage in negligent actions that endanger the safety, health and overall wellbeing of residents.<\/p>\n<p>The estate of an 84-year-old former nursing home resident, recently filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the nursing home and a former nursing home employee. The lawsuit details how negligent acts carried out by the nursing home and employee allowed the 84-year-old woman to wander from the home&#8217;s walls and out into the cold.<\/p>\n<p>The former employee named as a defendant in the lawsuit was the only employee on duty the night the 84-year-old wandered off. The employee was responsible for supervising 30 patients and is accused of failing to provide a safe environment and proper nursing care.<\/p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, the 84-year-old woman suffered numerous injuries and \u00a0severe emotional and mental pain and distress as a direct result of the defendants&#8217; negligence. The lawsuit is seeking an unspecified amount of damages.<\/p>\n<p>Family members who question a loved one&#8217;s safety and wellbeing at a nursing home or assisted care facility should take action. Dropping by unexpectedly, inspecting a loved one&#8217;s body for bruises or sores and questioning staff and administrators is a good way to gauge if problems associated with nursing home neglect or abuse may be an issue.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:\u00a0<\/b>Vindy.com, &#8220;Estate of woman who died at nursing home sues,&#8221; April 21, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All Ohio families eventually must have frank discussions on how to best care and provide for an aging loved one.
