The Ohio Highway Patrol says that the <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a> happened at about 10:25 a.m. on Route 105 near Bowling Green. A 58-year-old man was traveling west on the highway when his vehicle went left of the center line and collided head-on into another vehicle. The patrol said in a written statement that the collision caused heavy, disabling damage to both of the vehicles involved. <\/p>\n<p>The man in the first vehicle was taken to Wood County Hospital with serious injuries and was pronounced deceased there. The 74-year-old man driving the other vehicle and his 73-year-old wife, who was a passenger, suffered what appeared to be non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to the same hospital. All of the people involved were wearing their safety belts. Troopers do not believe that alcohol was a factor in the car accident, but they are still investigating the case. <\/p>\n<p>The injured husband and wife in this car accident may file a personal injury claim to secure compensation for the medical bills associated with their injuries. The couple, however, has to provide proof to a judge that the driver of the other vehicle failed to exhibit reasonable care and caused the accident that led to their injuries. <\/p>\n<p>If the car accident was the result of a vehicle or part defect, the couple needs to file the personal injury claim against the automaker, parts manufacturer, or parts distributor. Again, they need to provide proof that one or more of the companies was negligent in not issuing a recall. The compensation from a successful claim of this nature may also cover the cost of their medical bills and the damage to their vehicle. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>Norwalk Reflector, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.norwalkreflector.com\/article\/4091531\" target=\"_blank\">2-car crash kills one, injures two<\/a>&#8220;, February 02, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A two-car crash on Feb. 2 killed an Ohio man and injured two other people.
