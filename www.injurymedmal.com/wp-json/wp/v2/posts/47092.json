For TBIs that are quite severe acute treatment may be needed. The purpose of this type of treatment is to minimize life support and secondary injury.<\/p>\n<p>When the brain suffers such a serious injury, the intracranial pressure can quickly rise. A device can be surgically inserted into the cavity of the brain that can monitor the pressure and help control it.<\/p>\n<p>The patient could be given medications that put him or her into a coma. This helps prevent the patient from further injuring him- or herself and to keep him or her from becoming too agitated. Since seizures can also be a strong possibility, medications that prevent seizures may also be prescribed.<\/p>\n<p>When the patient begins to show signs of recovering some function, more medications can be ordered for controlling aggressive behavior as well as other behavioral issues. In addition, medication may be able to help attention problems, too.<\/p>\n<p>Because the symptoms that a patient with a TBI may experience can vary significantly, treatments are often not identical. Some of the symptoms for a severe TBI include:<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Speaking very fast or slow<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Not understanding what is said<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Loss or partial loss of vision<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Photophobia or an intolerance of light<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Increased sensitivity to sound, tinnitus or loss of hearing<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Seizures<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Paralysis<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Loss of bladder and bowel control<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Aggression, depression, lack of awareness and disinhibition<\/p>\n<p>Have your or a loved one suffered a TBI?
