In some cases, the accident may be caused by driver error; in other cases, the issue may have been with the road conditions.<\/p>\n<p>The most frequent cause attributed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wisegeek.com\/what-are-the-common-causes-of-highway-fatalities.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vehicle accident fatalities<\/a> is human error. The most publicized example in this category is drunk or impaired driving. Alcohol and drugs can affect a driver&#8217;s motor skills, making a collision more likely. Another example is distracted driving. It&#8217;s not uncommon for drivers to look at their phone while driving, but taking their eyes off the road can lead to rear-end collisions if they&#8217;re not paying close attention.<\/p>\n<p>Not every collision is due to the fault of a driver: Weather plays a significant role in many accidents. Rain, snow and ice can make traction on a highway difficult and lead to single- or multiple-vehicle accidents. Fog and rain can lead to low visibility that affects a driver&#8217;s responsiveness. Another cause of fatal collisions is faulty road design. Some states have designed their roads in a way that leads to increased accidents involving blind intersections, tight turns and missing shoulders.<\/p>\n<p>When an individual is killed in a vehicle accident due to the negligence or error of another, the estate of that individual may have a claim for damages including medical bills, pain and suffering, future earnings and funeral costs. An attorney with experience in <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">auto accident injuries compensation<\/a> may be able to help the survivors of that individual collect damages. An attorney may be able to file a lawsuit, file motions and seek discovery responses while preparing for a jury trial. Alternatively, the attorney might negotiate a settlement with the responsible party or their insurance company.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The causes of fatal accidents in Ohio can vary by a significant degree.
