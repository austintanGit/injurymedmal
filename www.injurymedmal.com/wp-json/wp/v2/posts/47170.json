The first accident was reported in Licking County about 7:46 a.m. One vehicle was involved, which struck a tree after traveling off the right side of the roadway into a brushy area.<\/p>\n<p>The 47-year-old driver was thrown from car, and he died at the accident site, according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol. It&#8217;s believed the crash actually occurred hours before as the Licking County coroner&#8217;s office believed the man died between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>The Knox County accident happened at about 8:40 a.m., and involved three vehicles. A 79-year-old man driving a Ford Ranger was turning off Route 13 when he was struck by a vehicle driven by a 21-year-old man. The pickup was pushed into the opposite lanes of travel, where it was struck by a vehicle driven by a 22-year-old woman.<\/p>\n<p>The 79-year-old man was ejected from the pickup, and he died at the crash site. The 22-year-old was transported to Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University. She reportedly had non-life threatening injuries. The 22-year-old man received treatment at the accident scene.<\/p>\n<p>The highway patrol is still investigating both accidents.<\/p>\n<p>While it doesn&#8217;t appear likely that the family of the victim in the first accident will be able to seek compensation from another driver, the second accident is differed. When you are injured or someone you love is killed in a car accident that was caused by another&#8217;s negligence, you have a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/\">right to seek compensation<\/a>. A lawyer can help you learn how this is done, and can help you hold the responsible party accountable for his or her actions. You may be able to seek compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering, final expenses and more.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> dispatch.com, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dispatch.com\/content\/stories\/local\/2016\/11\/18\/Licking-County-fatal-crash.html\" target=\"_blank\">2 killed in separate wrecks on Route 13 in Licking, Knox counties<\/a>,&#8221; Jennifer Smola, Nov. 18, 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two men have lost their lives in separate crashes on Route 13 in Knox and Licking, Ohio.
