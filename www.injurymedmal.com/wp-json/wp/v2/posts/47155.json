If a person has trouble walking, this could also be a related indicator.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; An increased heart rate and\/or dropping blood pressure levels.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Eyes that appear too sunken into the head or an excessively dry mouth.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, tracking the loss of bodily fluids may also help.
