According to troopers, the accident was the result of a 26-year-old driver who failed to stop at a stop sign. In addition to the two fatalities, two other people were reportedly injured in the crash. None of the occupants of either of the two vehicles had been wearing seat belts.<\/p>\n<p>The fatal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">car accident<\/a> took place shortly before 1:32 a.m. at the intersection of state Route 203 and Keener Road. When a 31-year-old man driving a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am missed a stop sign, his vehicle collided with a 1998 Honda CRV. The driver of the Honda died at the scene of the crash, and a 24-year-old passenger in the Honda died while being transported to the hospital. Another 19-year-old passenger in the Honda was taken to Grant Medical Center for treatment of incapacitating injuries.<\/p>\n<p>After someone is killed in a car accident by no fault of their own, the deceased person&#8217;s family members may decide to file a wrongful death claim. Family members may gather evidence to support their claim that includes police reports and testimony from witnesses who were at the scene. An attorney may help family members to compile this evidence and present their case to a judge.<\/p>\n<p>What type of damages the victim&#8217;s family may claim will depend on the nature of the accident and whether or not the victim was the main breadwinner. In many cases, family members ask for compensation for end-of-life medical care, pain and suffering and funeral expenses. Family members may sometimes seek additional compensation for their grief and loss of financial contributions.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:\u00a0<\/b>NBC 4i, &#8220;2 Killed, 2 Injured In Early Morning Crash In Marion County&#8221;, Joe Clark, December 08, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ohio State Troopers suspect alcohol was involved in a two-vehicle accident that left two people dead in Ohio.
