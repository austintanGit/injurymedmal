That&#8217;s why safety advocates want to use modern technology to minimize the number of accidents involving big rigs. In particular, forward crash avoidance and mitigation systems have been touted as potential saviors. <\/p>\n<p>In 2017, more than 4,100 individuals died in <a href=\"https:\/\/filthylucre.com\/fatal-truck-crash\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accidents involving large trucks<\/a>. A good portion of these individuals were pedestrians and drivers in passenger cars. While any accident involving a big rig has the potential to be devastating, some of the most serious accidents involve large trucks rear-ending smaller vehicles. <\/p>\n<p>The number 4,100 becomes more devastating when compared to fatalities in air travel. For this many people to die in aviation, a 737 full of passengers would have to crash twice every month with complete fatalities. <\/p>\n<p>Many feel that the regulatory institutions that have the responsibility for making the highway safe are not reacting as aggressively as they should. Safety advocates say that implementing forward crash avoidance and mitigation technology could significantly lower the accident rate. Despite these recommendations, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has yet to require large commercial trucks to have these systems.<\/p>\n<p>The family of a victim killed in a truck crash may want to speak to an attorney. A <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/wrongful-death\/\">wrongful death attorney<\/a> could help family members of the deceased by holding the at-fault parties accountable. After reviewing investigations, witness testimony and information gathered by security cameras, the lawyer could bring a wrongful death claim to court. The victim&#8217;s family could ultimately receive compensation covering various damages. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When an accident involving a large truck occurs in Ohio, the results can be catastrophic.
