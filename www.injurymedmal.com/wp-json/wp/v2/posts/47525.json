On Feb. 14, the man was reportedly driving northbound on Byrne Road at 80-100 miles per hour when he struck the back of a car occupied by a 47-year-old woman. Her car was stopped at a red light on Byrne Street at Dorn Street when the accident took place. <\/p>\n<p>The accident caused the woman&#8217;s car to be pushed into the back of an SUV while the man&#8217;s vehicle also hit a pickup truck. There was no information given as to whether the drivers in the other vehicles were injured. A blood plasma test taken after the crash revealed that his blood alcohol content was .28 percent. That is more than three times the legal limit in Ohio. <\/p>\n<p>In addition to his jail sentence, the man had his driver&#8217;s license suspended for life and must pay $30,000 in restitution. While his attorney pleaded for a lighter sentence, the judge noted that he had a prior public intoxication charge on his record. The judge reasoned that the charge in itself should have served as a warning. <\/p>\n<p>In a case where a driver is killed in a <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/car-accidents\/\">car accident<\/a>, the driver responsible for that accident may be held liable financially. Either at trial or in a settlement, the family of the victim may be entitled to compensation to cover final expenses of a loved one. These expenses may include funeral expenses or the cost to settle that person&#8217;s estate. Additionally, punitive damages or compensation to provide for the victim&#8217;s dependents may also be awarded to the family. <\/p>\n<p> <b>Source:&nbsp;<\/b>The Blade, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.toledoblade.com\/Courts\/2014\/08\/27\/Ohio-man-gets-7-years-for-slamming-killing-driver-in-intoxicated-crash.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ohio man gets 7 years for slamming, killing driver in intoxicated crash <\/a>&#8220;, August 27, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A 22-year-old man was sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading no contest to a charge of vehicular homicide.
