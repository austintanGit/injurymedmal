According to media reports, the teen&#8217;s muscles were swollen and too tender to touch. Concerned, his mother searched the internet and found information on a potentially deadly medical condition called rhabdomyolysis, or rhabdo. She informed the family pediatrician of her suspicion, and the teen was later diagnosed with the condition. He was hospitalized for five days and is expected to make a full recovery. <\/p>\n<p>Rhabdomyolysis causes damaged muscle tissues to break down, which releases a protein called myoglobin into the bloodstream. This protein can harm kidney cells and eventually cause kidney damage. Symptoms of the condition include muscle soreness, fatigue, fever, bruising, nausea, infrequent urination and a rapid heart rate. Medical experts say the condition can be caused by physical muscle injuries, such as overexercise, or genetic muscle injuries. Accidents, burns, electric shocks, venomous bites, infections, alcohol and illegal drugs can also trigger the condition. Each year, approximately 26,000 cases of rhabdo are reported across the U.S. In order to reduce the risk of exercise-related cases, doctors recommend that people drink plenty of fluids when working out. <\/p>\n<p>If rhabdo patients are not promptly diagnosed, they could suffer permanent kidney damage and\/or death. Victims of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis have the right to pursue compensation in court. By filing a medical malpractice lawsuit, they could receive a settlement that covers medical expenses and other damages. <a href=\"\/medical-malpractice\/\">Malpractice lawyers<\/a> could help patients gather evidence that shows medical negligence. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ohio fitness enthusiasts know that sore muscles often follow a heavy workout.
