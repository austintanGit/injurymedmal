These challenges can make it difficult for them to get an education. In some cases, a child who was excelling in school before the accident might find it difficult to keep up with the basics. There are several reasons why the child might experience difficulties learning.<\/p>\n<p>Memory issues are one of the most obvious reasons for a child to have difficulties in school after a brain injury. Not only do some children lose past memory in a brain injury, they can also have difficulty retaining new information because of the brain injury. That can make school a challenge because having a sharp memory is vital so the child can take in the vast amount of information that is presented on a daily basis.<\/p>\n<p>A child who suffered a brain injury might also suffer from hearing difficulties. Hearing loss associated with the brain injury, as well as tinnitus, can make it hard to concentrate in class. In some instances, this might be compensated for by offering printed materials, but even that can cause trouble because some children who suffered a brain injury might have trouble with reading.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, a child who suffers a brain injury might need intensive help to stay on track with schooling. That help is likely to put a strain on the parents&#8217; finances. Some parents might opt to seek compensation for the child&#8217;s accident so that they can give their child all the assistance necessary to help the child after the accident.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.asha.org\/About\/news\/TBI-In-Kids-And-Teens-Can-Impact-School-Performance\/\" target=\"_blank\">Traumatic Brain Injury In Kids And Teens Can Impact School Performance<\/a>,&#8221; accessed Oct. 28, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In our previous blog post, we briefly discussed how children who have suffered brain injuries can often experience some challenges when they go back to school.
