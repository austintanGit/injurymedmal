While dedicated bike lanes are often available in major metropolitan areas and seek to make riding alongside traffic safer for bikers, the possibility of injury or even death still remains.<\/p>\n<p>According to reports, a 16-year-old passed away from injuries related to an accident that occurred on May 19. The teen was apparently riding his bicycle in the regular traffic lanes when he was hit by a car from behind. Reports from the accident indicate that the teen was correctly riding with the flow of traffic at the time of the accident, although it is unclear whether he was using the signaling devices required by Ohio law. Those riding bikes during the hours of sunset to sunrise must either have operational lights or reflectors on both the front and rear of their bikes.<\/p>\n<p>The boy was reportedly transported to UC Medical Center by AirCare immediately after the accident. He was treated for an unspecified head injury before being released to his family. According to reports, the teen&#8217;s father did not believe the boy was well enough to go home. A few days after his release, the boy was found by his sister on the bedroom floor apparently experiencing a seizure. He was taken back to the hospital for a blood clot on his brain but went into a coma and died.<\/p>\n<p>Accidents involving pedestrians or bicyclists are often very serious because the victims stand a greater chance of severe injury or death due to the lack of protection from the vehicle&#8217;s impact. While filing a lawsuit against the at-fault party brings little emotional relief to the family of the victim, it can reduce some of the financial burden.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> WCPO, &#8220;Teen cyclist struck dies weeks after treated, released from hospital,&#8221; Pat LaFleur and Tom McKee, June 02, 2015<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many bicycle riders enjoy the warmer temperatures of the summer months, and motorists may notice an increased presence on Ohio&#8217;s roads.
