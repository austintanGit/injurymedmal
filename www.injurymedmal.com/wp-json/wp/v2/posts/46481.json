After analyzing 1,800 closed claims against physicians from 2013 to 2017, researchers found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.claimsjournal.com\/news\/national\/2019\/03\/21\/289896.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">46 percent involved misdiagnoses<\/a>. These diagnosis-related claims accounted for 68 percent of all paid indemnity costs. Forty-five percent of the patients in these cases died.<\/p>\n<p>The Doctors Company, another malpractice insurer, made its report after reviewing 1,215 claims closed between 2008 and 2017. It found that 38 percent of pediatric claims involved a misdiagnosis and that the misdiagnoses were largely the result of inadequate patient assessments. The fault lay largely with primary care providers who, for example, would fail to capture a complete family history or perform a complete physical exam.<\/p>\n<p>Primary care providers are in charge of not only the patient assessments but also the selection of treatment or therapy and the monitoring of any high-risk medications that patients take. The second most common allegations in diagnosis-related claims were connected to the ordering of diagnostic tests. After that were allegations concerning referrals and follow-ups.<\/p>\n<p>A misdiagnosis can result in unnecessary treatments and, with it, mounting medical expenses.
