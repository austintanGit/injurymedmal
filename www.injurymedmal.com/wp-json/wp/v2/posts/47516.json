Two cars were involved in the accident that occurred around 12:35 p.m. In addition to the two fatalities, four other people were injured.<\/p>\n<p>Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers say that the accident occurred when a 1996 Buick Regal driven by an 18-year-old male struck a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu near the intersection of State Route 4 and Brokensword Road. The driver of the Malibu, a 53-year-old woman and her 56-year-old husband, who was a passenger, both died at the scene of the accident.<\/p>\n<p>The driver of the Buick and three of his passengers suffered injuries and were taken to hospitals. One passenger, a 21-year-old woman, was taken to Saint Vincent&#8217;s Hospital in Toledo by Mercy Life Flight. The driver and two male passengers, aged 18 and 19, were all taken by ambulance to Bucyrus Community Hospital.<\/p>\n<p>According to troopers, the driver of the Buick failed to stop at a stop sign prior to the crash. Investigators are still investigating the accident.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, if the accident investigation uncovered evidence that the driver of the Buick did fail to stop at a posted stop sign as the troopers&#8217; report indicated, the driver could be liable for negligence in the deaths of the people in the other car. The family of someone who is killed in a car accident could bring a wrongful death lawsuit against a driver when there is evidence of negligence. An attorney could explain a family&#8217;s rights and represent them if a decision was made to file a legal complaint against a driver or against another party who could be negligent, such as an automobile manufacturer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:\u00a0<\/strong>nbci4.com, &#8220;Reynoldsburg Couple Killed In Crawford County Crash&#8221;, Alex Mazer, October 17, 2014<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two people from Ohio were killed in a car accident that happened in Crawford County on Oct. 17.
