The prescribing doctor, an occupational medicine specialist, is also named as a defendant.<\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit, which was filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, seeks unspecified damages in a jury trial for funeral and burial expenses, loss of support, mental anguish and loss of prospective inheritance. Her attorney believes that &#8220;this is a multimillion dollar case.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, the woman&#8217;s husband suffered a back injury at work. He was treated at the LakeHealth emergency room in Willoughby. The physician prescribed opiates to the man, and according to the woman&#8217;s attorney, for too long of a time and did not spot or treat the man&#8217;s signs of addiction.<\/p>\n<p>Lake Hospital System, Inc., according to the lawsuit, did not &#8220;recognize a rampant prescription overdose crisis&#8221; in Ohio. As a result, Lake Hospital System, Inc. failed to create and implement proper opiate prescribing procedures for its employees and agents.&#8221; In addition, the attorney says that the hospital system should have realized that the physician was not experienced in &#8220;pain management prescribing knowledge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The man was on prescription opiates for five years. The physician doesn&#8217;t work for the medical system any longer, but is now the director of laboratory services for Signature Health.<\/p>\n<p>Wrongful death lawsuits allow family members to hold people and entities responsible for someone&#8217;s death due to negligence.
