For many, one is a change in appetite. In some cases involving children, those children will actually refuse to eat.<\/p>\n<p>There could be many reasons for this refusal, but it&#8217;s worth noting that brain injuries can often lead to a bad taste in one&#8217;s mouth. They can also induce vomiting or make a person feel nauseated. Both of these could then make that person more unlikely to eat and could ruin that person&#8217;s appetite.<\/p>\n<p>With young children, there can be communication issues that are not even related to the injury, as it&#8217;s simply hard for them to explain how they feel or they may be so young that verbal communication is impossible. They may be experiencing these related symptoms, feeling sick even though they can&#8217;t say so, and all that parents will see is a refusal to eat. This can tip parents off that something is wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Brain injuries can also lead to attitude shifts and mood changes. With kids, these can also lead to a refusal to eat. It is tough for parents to get some children to eat normally, of course, but parents may want to think about a brain injury if a child who typically eats very well suddenly seems agitated and refuses to do so.<\/p>\n<p>If you or your child has suffered a brain injury, it may be possible to seek compensation in Ohio. This can help to cover immediate medical costs, <a href=\"\/catastrophic-injuries-fatalities\/traumatic-brain-injuries\/\">rehab costs<\/a>, and the like. You may also be able to seek compensation for long-term changes and care that will be needed.<\/p>\n<p><b>Source:<\/b> Brainline, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.brainline.org\/landing_pages\/categories\/symptoms.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brain Injury Symptoms<\/a>,&#8221; accessed Sep. 30, 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Brain injuries often impact different people in different ways, so it&#8217;s important to look at all possible symptoms.
