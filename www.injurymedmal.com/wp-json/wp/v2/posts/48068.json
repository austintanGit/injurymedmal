The tragedy of any accident is multiplied when those involved are children. A recent accident in Ohio claimed the life of a mother and son, and left the family&#8217;s father and daughter critically <a title=\"injured\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">injured<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">The family was traveling&nbsp;on state Route 83&nbsp;when a 35-year-old driver veered from the other lane and collided with the vehicle head-on. Emergency responders arrived at the scene, but they were unable to save all of the victims. The 36-year-old mother and her 11-year-old son were pronounced dead at the scene while the 38-year-old father, an Ohio police officer, and his 13-year-old daughter were rushed to Ohio hospitals&nbsp;with critical injuries.<\/p>\n<p>Officials believe that the man responsible for the car accident was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash. The man reportedly has a history of drunk driving. A blood test was taken when the man was transported to the hospital after the crash. The results of that test are still pending, but Ohio Highway Patrol officers say that they will present all of their evidence to the prosecutor&#8217;s office as soon as the report comes back.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of the blood alcohol test, the victims in the crash and their family members have suffered serious personal injuries. Not only did two people suffer serious injuries, they also lost loved ones in the crash. Although personal injury compensation can never replace this family&#8217;s loss, it could help offset medical bills, vehicle damage and other financial consequences of this tragic accident.<\/p>\n<p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><strong>Source:<\/strong> Chronicle.northcoastnow.com, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/chronicle.northcoastnow.com\/2011\/06\/12\/two-killed-two-critically-injured-in-head-on-crash-in-grafton\" target=\"_blank\">Two killed- 3 critically injured in head-on crash in Grafton<\/a>,&#8221; Evan Goodenow, 12 June 2011<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Car accidents that involve fatalities are both frightening and heartbreaking.
