The former co-frontman for The Eagles reportedly died of complications from acute ulcerative colitis, pneumonia and other health conditions. He was 67. <\/p>\n<p>The suit claims that a gastroenterologist at Manhattan&#8217;s Mount Sinai Hospital failed to properly treat Frey&#8217;s ulcerative colitis and an infection. It further claims the doctor failed to tell him about the side effects and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-music-frey\/widow-of-eagles-guitarist-frey-sues-nyc-hospital-for-wrongful-death-idUSKBN1F5241\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risks associated with treatment<\/a>. As a result, the musician was rendered disabled and suffered physical pain and mental anguish in the months leading up to his death. <\/p>\n<p>According to court documents, Frey was under the doctor&#8217;s care from October to November 2015. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, was filed before New York&#8217;s two-year deadline for wrongful death suits expired. A spokesperson for Mount Sinai Hospital declined to comment on the case. Frey sang lead vocals on many of The Eagles greatest hits, including &#8220;Take It Easy&#8221; and &#8220;Heartache Tonight&#8221;. He also had a successful solo career, recording hits such as &#8220;The Heat Is On&#8221; and &#8220;Smuggler&#8217;s Blues&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Negligent doctors and hospitals harm thousands of Americans every year.
