What this means is that a distance between two vehicles traveling in the same lane must be enough so that if the first vehicle were to stop or begin moving at a slower speed, the vehicle in the rear would have enough time to also stop or slow down in order to avoid a collision.<\/p>\n<p>Failure to assure a clear distance can cause a&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lvtbd.com\/Auto-Accident-Injuries\/Car-Accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">car accident<\/a>. This happened in Goshen Township, Ohio, recently when a vehicle stopped for paving work. Just as that vehicle started moving again, it was hit from behind by another vehicle. The 28-year-old driver of the first vehicle was transported to the hospital with injuries from the accident. The 22-year-old driver of the second vehicle was given a citation for failing to maintain an assured clear distance.<\/p>\n<p>Following at a safe distance sometimes involves taking into consideration inclement weather conditions, night driving, hills or curves in the road, and poor lighting. Drivers who rear-end other vehicles are often found liable for accidents caused, with the main exception to that rule being if a vehicle suddenly pulls in front of another.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Those who are injured in car accidents due to someone else&#8217;s failure to maintain a clear distance may be entitled to compensation through a personal injury claim for the expenses caused by the accident. Expenses often covered in the claim include medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering. This money is generally paid by the insurance company of the driver who caused the accident.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<\/strong>Times Reporter, &#8220;Bowerston woman injured in crash,&#8221; July 15, 2013<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drivers are required to maintain an &#8220;assured clear distance&#8221; from the vehicles in front of them.
