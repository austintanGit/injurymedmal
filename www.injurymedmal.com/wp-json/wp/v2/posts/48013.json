A third man who was involved in the accident was not hurt. Police are continuing to investigate the cause of the fatal crash, the 43rd and 44th traffic-related fatalities in Columbus this year.<\/p>\n<p>One of the men killed was the 45-year-old driver of a tractor-trailer traveling westbound on Interstate 70. For as yet unknown reasons, he lost control of the truck, which rolled onto its side and crossed the center median. The 18-year-old driver of a GMC Jimmy was traveling eastbound on I-70 and was hit by the truck in a head-on collision. Emergency responders declared both drivers dead at the scene of the <a href=\"\/auto-accident-injuries\/truck-accidents\/\" target=\"_blank\">trucking accident<\/a>. The third man was driving a Ford pickup that was hit by crash debris, but he was uninjured.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cause for the truck driver&#8217;s loss of control could have been due to any number of reasons, including a manufacturing defect or negligence on his part. If the former, his family may be able to file a lawsuit against the vehicle manufacturer or other parties whose negligent acts contributed to the fatal accident. On the other hand, no information was released to indicate that the Jimmy driver did anything to cause the collision.<\/p>\n<p>A wrongful death suit appears to be applicable, particularly on behalf of the 18-year-old victim. When a victim dies due to the negligence of another, the family he or she leaves behind can seek compensation for their damages and pain and suffering. While the law cannot ever provide full relief for the families of the two drivers, it can provide important financial amends.<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong>Source:<\/strong><\/strong><\/strong> NBC 4, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www2.nbc4i.com\/news\/2011\/oct\/05\/drivers-killed-head-collision-i-70-are-identified-ar-772681\" target=\"_blank\">Drivers Killed In Head-On Collision On I-70 Are Identified<\/a>,&#8221; Donna Willis, Oct. 5, 2011<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two men were fatally injured in a trucking accident that occurred on Oct. 3 in Columbus.
