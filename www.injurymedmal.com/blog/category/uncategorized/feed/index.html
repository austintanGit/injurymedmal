																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most births in the United States are routine procedures, where both the child and mother are healthy without experiencing complications. However, some situations increase the likelihood of a traumatic birth. A traumatic birth can lead to injuries to the baby. The baby may experience broken bones, bruising or swelling of the scalp. Oxygen deprivation, in particular, can lead to very severe issues for the infant, and can cause seizures, blindness or learning difficulties.
If your child has suffered as a result of birth trauma in Ohio, you may have reason to believe that the complications occurred due to medical negligence. If this is the case, you may be able to take action and make a successful legal claim against the hospital or the medical professional.
What are common instances of medical negligence relating to birth injuries?
The actions of a medical professional in response to a birth complication can unnecessarily lead to a birth trauma, and this usually constitutes medical negligence. For example, if a baby has an abnormality detected by a medical professional but this information is not passed on to the mother or to the appropriate doctors, the birth may be carried out without complete information, and complications can arise.
Additionally, a poorly performed hysterectomy can lead to an unintended pregnancy with complications. If medical malpractice was the cause of the unsuccessful hysterectomy, action can be taken against the surgeon who performed it.
Another common cause of birth trauma is the failure to schedule or perform a cesarean section. A cesarean section is one of the most successful ways of avoiding potential birth complications that arise from issues such as the baby being in the breach position. If a doctor does not schedule a cesarean section and complications arise that lead to preventable birth trauma, you may be able to hold the doctor liable.
It is important that you understand the way in which decisions were made when you were giving birth to your child, and how the complications could have been prevented. You should take action to learn more about medical malpractice if you believe it was present when you were giving birth.The post When is birth trauma a type of medical malpractice? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Traffic accidents are caused by a number of factors. Some of these unsafe factors make a major difference in the likelihood that you&#8217;re going to get home safely when traveling.
Although it may not seem like it, simple things like rain or darkness can make traffic much more dangerous. The good news is that you can recognize these unsafe driving factors and avoid making mistakes that result in injuries.
Traffic crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States, according to 2015 statistics. There has been a 19-percent decrease in the number of crashes in the last decade, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that drivers can afford to relax. Some of the following are causes of crashes that you should watch out for.
1. Traffic jams
Traffic jams are one cause of collisions on highways. These jams are difficult for drivers, because they&#8217;re slowed down, stopping and accelerating at random times. It&#8217;s hard to predict the flow of traffic, so everyone has to pay close attention. Failing to do so due to distractions or other causes can result in rear-end crashes, which then continue to increase the amount of backed up traffic.
2. Poor skills
When there are many people on the roads with weak driving skills, there&#8217;s a higher risk of a crash taking place. For example, if you&#8217;re driving near a high school, it&#8217;s possible that you&#8217;ll be surrounded by new drivers. These drivers don&#8217;t have much experience, which puts them at a higher likelihood of making mistakes.
3. Drowsiness
Another hazard is drowsiness. When a driver is drowsy, they aren&#8217;t paying attention in the way that they should. They may be fighting to stay awake or not notice that they&#8217;re falling asleep during a drive. Even nodding off for a few seconds is enough to lead to a serious collision with another driver.
4. Construction work
Finally, there is construction work. Construction work is dangerous for a few reasons. The roads might be uneven, arranged differently than usual or there may be objects in or near the roadway. Drivers who are approaching construction zones should take the time to slow down and avoid colliding with any person or item that is there. It may take longer to get through the zone, but it&#8217;s worth protecting people&#8217;s lives.
These are a few reasons for auto accidents. Take your time, so you can reduce the chance of being involved in one yourself.The post Traffic hazards can pose a threat to drivers on the roads first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine a semitruck slams into the back of your compact Honda while you are stopped at a red light. Even though your vehicle bounces forward into the intersection, you are lucky to survive the collision without any life-threatening injuries. However, you do need to go to the hospital for a strained neck and a broken wrist.
Since the accident was the fault of the semitruck driver, you probably have a viable claim for damages you can make in court. To preserve your legal rights, and increase the chances of success in your personal injury action, it&#8217;s important that you follow these five steps immediately after the crash:
Remain at the crash site: It&#8217;s illegal to leave the scene of a serious car accident. Not only that, but you will want to ensure that police arrive to document what happened in the crash and make a fault determination. The information in the police report may help to support your personal injury case.
Make sure everyone is okay: Check yourself for injuries, check your passengers and check the other drivers, passengers and anyone else involved in the collision. If you&#8217;re able, tend to them in any way you can. If someone is unconscious or is complaining of serious back or neck pain, let the paramedics take care of moving him or her &#8212; unless some hazard is putting the person&#8217;s life in jeopardy.
Call 911: Call for emergency assistance if people are seriously hurt. Otherwise, simply contact the police and wait at the scene until they arrive. Write down the name and badge numbers of all the officers who come to investigate the crash.
Trade information: Get the names and contact information of everyone who was involved in or witnessed the accident and ask to look at their IDs. Also, collect the license plate numbers and insurance information for any drivers.
Take copious notes and pictures: Ask witnesses and others what they saw in the crash and take notes on what they say, as well as recording their contact information. Take pictures of the crash site, your injuries and the vehicles.
Of course, if you&#8217;re seriously hurt, you might not be able to do any of these things after an auto collision. Your first priority is to get the medical care you need, then tend to the rest. Once you&#8217;re feeling better, you may want to begin the process of reviewing whether you can pursue financial damages in court after your car crash.The post 5 steps after a car accident first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you had to quickly name the leading causes of death in the United States, you&#8217;d probably start with cancer. It gets a lot of press. It can be treated but not always cured. We know it&#8217;s deadly.
Next, maybe you&#8217;d settle on heart attacks or simply heart issues in general. You know that America has an obesity epidemic. It stands to reason that heart disease has to be pretty high up on the list.
Then where would you go? Car accidents? Violent crime? Natural disasters?
These all play a role every year, but the reality is something many people overlook. While heart diseases and cancer are the top two causes of death for Americans, the No. 3 cause of death is medical mistakes. These errors, made by the very same people that we entrust with our health, take over 250,000 lives every year.
Types of mistakes
You see a statistic like that and you instantly wonder what could go wrong. What types of issues take so many lives annually?
The range is huge. In some cases, doctors simply mix up paperwork. One patient does not get the right medication or gets medicine intended for someone else or gets a dose that is far too high or too low. In a stressful, high-speed work environment, these little slip-ups are easy, but they can take lives.
In other cases, doctors make direct mistakes. A surgeon forgets an implement in a patient after surgery or makes an error during the surgery itself that has dire consequences. The surgical team gives the patient too much medication or accidentally gives them something they&#8217;re allergic to. Things are very fragile, and a tiny error is all it takes.
Fixing the problem
So, how can we fix this? How can we get the numbers down and save lives?
Researchers believe that it starts with just that: research. We need to document these cases and collect data. This can help to expose trends and show why mistakes happen and why they happen so often. Armed with that information, professionals can seek ways to lower the error rates.
&#8220;While no method of investigating and documenting preventable harm is perfect,&#8221; one report noted, &#8220;some form of data collection of death due to medical error is needed to address the problem.&#8221;
If you didn&#8217;t guess that medical mistakes were the No. 3 leading cause of death at the beginning, that shows part of the reason this problem exists. People just don&#8217;t know how big of a problem it is. Exposing it and gathering data helps work toward that goal.
Your rights
For now, though, you need to know your rights if you have suffered a serious injury or lost a loved one due to a medical error.The post Heart disease, cancer and medical mistakes: Top U.S. deaths first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are safe drivers, reckless drivers and those who lie somewhere in between. You don&#8217;t have any control over other drivers, but there are always things you can do to enhance your safety and attempt to avoid an accident.
One of the best things you can do is become a defensive driver. Here are five tips that will help you to do just that:

Always plan ahead. Think about what you&#8217;re getting into before you ever put your car in drive. For example, if you know you&#8217;ll sit in rush hour traffic, prepare your mind accordingly. This will help you make sound decisions when the time comes.
Don&#8217;t lose sight of others. You can&#8217;t watch everyone all the time, but you should keep a close eye on drivers close to your vehicle. If you spot someone driving in a reckless or aggressive manner, create as much space between your vehicles as possible.
Slow down. You shouldn&#8217;t drive dangerously slow, but you must keep one eye on your speed at all times. There&#8217;s a speed limit for a reason, and you should follow it.
Don&#8217;t drive aggressively. If other drivers become aggressive, it&#8217;s easy to fall into the same trap. You may assume you have to do the same in order to protect yourself. This isn&#8217;t true. You should remain a defensive driver regardless of what&#8217;s happening around you.
Becoming distracted. Being a defensive driver means paying attention to the road at all times. You shouldn&#8217;t send text messages while you&#8217;re driving, talk on the phone, eat or drink.

There are many types of distractions, all of which increase the risk of an accident. Don&#8217;t let these become a problem for you. When you actively try to become a defensive driver, it&#8217;s much easier to make progress. And as you make progress, you&#8217;ll realize that you feel better about your ability to remain safe.
If you&#8217;re part of a motor vehicle accident, pull to safety and take steps to protect your health and well-being. For example, call 911 and avoid confrontation with the person who caused the accident.
When the time comes, contact your insurance agent to file a claim and take steps to protect your legal rights.The post Follow these steps to become a defensive driver first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you live in the Columbus area, you have probably found yourself sharing the road with large commercial trucks at one time or another. And, if you are like most other drivers, you have probably felt a stab of nervousness as a big rig has drifted into your lane or come barreling past you on the highway.
While there are generally fewer instances of accidents involving a semitruck than there are collisions involving only passenger vehicles, the consequence of these wrecks are often far more devastating.
Part of staying safe on the road is understanding what types of dangerous situations you might experience along with their causes. If you know what to watch out for when driving near semitrucks, you will have a better chance of avoiding an accident. Here are some common causes of truck collisions.
Collisions caused by other drivers
In many cases, truck accidents happen because of the actions of drivers operating passenger vehicles. Usually, these drivers do not fully understand the limited performance abilities of large commercial rigs.
For example, a driver might cut off a truck and cause an accident because the semi needs much more time to slow down or stop and cannot adjust as quickly as a sedan can. Driving in a &#8220;no-zone,&#8221; or blind spot, of a truck can be extremely dangerous as well. You may be totally invisible to the truck driver and, thinking the lane is clear, the semi operator might change lanes and sideswipe you.
Also, many drivers fail to speed up or slow down when a big rig is entering the highway, changing lanes or merging. If you see a truck making such a move, it is always best to simply get out of the way to avoid a collision.
Collisions caused by commercial drivers
In some cases, a truck accident is the fault of the truck driver. For example, you have probably heard about truck accidents where the operator has fallen asleep due to pressure to meet delivery deadlines. Many truck companies have strict schedules that they have to stick to which causes management to put pressure on their drivers to drive as much as possible to meet these deadlines.
This can lead to speeding, driving drowsy and even distracted driving. In addition, if a load is improperly secured, it could result in an accident. A truck hauling items on a flatbed might lose the load and cause a car wreck if the tie downs are not properly tied and latched.
If you have been the victim of a truck accident, keep in mind that you have options. You might be able to file a claim for compensation for your injuries and other damages that resulted due to a wreck with a semitruck.The post Who is to blame for truck accidents? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a loving parent, you probably do everything you can to give your children a safe environment and the skills and resources they need for a healthy and happy future. Unfortunately, no matter how much you love your children, it is impossible to completely shield them from the dangers of the world.
Riding in a vehicle is a perfect example. The average American takes several car trips every day, usually arriving at the intended destination without issue. However, for a tiny fraction of individuals, the daily commute can end in tragedy.
Children are particularly susceptible to injuries in motor vehicle collisions. In fact, car crashes remain one of the top causes of death for children under the age of 18.
Focus on safety when your kids are in the car
Once your children reach a certain age, they likely have strong opinions about where they sit in the vehicle and how they entertain themselves during your travels. You must be careful, as a parent, not to let your desire to minimize the stress of travel to create a dangerous situation for your family. Your children must absolutely be in appropriate restraints.
Infants and newborns should be in specialized car seats, and older children should be in booster seats. Until your child is either 12 years old or 4&#8217;9&#8243; tall, they must remain in the boosters.
No matter how annoyed your child may be with the booster seat, that annoyance is infinitely preferable to serious injuries or death due to a child bring improperly restrained in the back seat of the vehicle.
When another driver endangers your family, you can hold them accountable
One of the most frightening realizations any driver can have is that their own safety is dependent on the behaviors of other people on the road. Far too many drivers make questionable decisions before they get behind the wheel. Whether it is choosing to drive exhausted or after having a few beers, the decision impacts everyone who shares the road with that individual.
If your children suffered injuries or died as a result of a car crash caused by another driver, you may have the legal right to hold that individual accountable for the losses they have caused you. Injuries to children are often very expensive, as a trauma as simple as a broken bone can impact development and health for many years.
Your family should not have to bear a financial burden because someone else made a terrible decision. If you wonder about your right to collect compensation after a crash that hurt your children, it may be time to talk with someone who has more understanding of the Ohio personal injury and wrongful death statutes regarding car accidents.The post Motor vehicle collisions remain a leading cause of child death first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Even if you consider yourself a safe driver, you could still be part of an accident that results in a variety of injuries. If this happens, you should seek immediate medical treatment, as doing so increases your chance of making a full recovery.
You never know what type of injuries you&#8217;ll suffer in a car accident. Any type of crash, even one at a low speed, can cause a serious injury. This is why it&#8217;s better to be safe than sorry when it comes to potential injuries.
Some of the most common car accident injuries include:

Brain trauma: From a concussion to a traumatic brain injury, brain trauma is a serious injury that can alter your life. An immediate diagnosis is a must, as this ensures that the right treatment strategy is in place.
Neck and back injuries: Many people assume that paralysis is the only back and neck injury that can cause serious problems, but there are others, such as strains and sprains, that result in pain.
Broken bones: The impact of a car accident can result in broken bones. These often occur in the hands, feet, legs and arms.
Burns and abrasions: Depending on the type of accident, burns and abrasions are common. For example, if your car begins to burn upon impact, it&#8217;s difficult to escape without this type of injury.
Emotional distress: Even if you escape a car accident without major injuries, you may still suffer from long-term emotional distress. For some, this is so bad that they&#8217;re never able to drive again.

Since you don&#8217;t know what to expect in regard to car accident injuries, you must rely on your medical team to guide you. Not only can they diagnose your injuries, but they can implement a treatment plan for helping you recover.
Once you understand your injuries, talk with your medical team about your long-term prognosis. Some people find that they&#8217;ll make a full recovery, while others learn that their injuries will impact them for the rest of their life.
As you recover, review your insurance policy and contact your insurer to learn more about the compensation you&#8217;re entitled to. Also, focus on the cause of the accident, as doing so will help you determine if the other party is liable for your injuries and other damages.The post Car accident injuries: You never know what to expect first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[As students enter college and begin exercising their autonomy, there is very high likelihood that many of them will drink while underage, typically at a party of some kind. This experience has been celebrated in movies and television shows for many years, and a majority of college students get to college assuming that this is normal and even expected. Of these students who choose to drink while still minors, some of them will also choose to drive.
While the experience may be normal, it is neither safe nor legal, and may place many more people at risk than just the student who chooses to drink and get behind the wheel. If they cause an accident, they may derail not only their own future opportunities, but also those of other victims in the accident. They may even put the host of the party where they drank in legal jeopardy.
If you recently suffered injuries because of an underage drunk driver, then you should begin building a strong injury claim as soon as you can, to ensure that your rights remain secure while you recover. As you build this claim and seek compensation, consider how social host liability may play a role in the matter.
What is social host liability?
Ohio is one of many states that observes social host liability, which places legal liability for underage drunk drinking on the shoulders of a host who serves or furnishes alcohol to minors. In broad terms, if a legal adult hosts a party, and a minor drinks alcohol provided at the party and later causes injuries or damage to property, the host may face liability as well as the minor. This expands the scope of an injury claim, if the underage drinker causes a car accident.
It is important to note that a host does not need to knowingly offer or give alcohol to a minor to face liability. In these cases, &#8220;serving&#8221; alcohol means that the host knowingly provides alcohol to a minor, whereas &#8220;furnishing&#8221; alcohol is much broader. It includes simply making it available to minors, even if the host does not actually witness any underage drinking.
Building a strong claim for a full recovery
While social host liability is not always a simple thing to resolve legally, it is certainly important to consider in any accident that includes underage drinking. As you consider the legal options that you have, make sure that carefully examine the details of your accident and the events that lead to it. A well-built legal strategy protects your rights and increases the likelihood of obtaining the complete compensation that you deserve as you work toward a full recovery.The post If a minor drives drunk, can a party host face liability? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the weeks and months after a serious car accident, victims may suffer through many kinds of pain during the recovery process, all while seeing serious medical bills and other expenses pile up. If an injury is severe or affects a specific function, it may keep the victim from working at all, with bills mounting while income is dropping.
If you recently suffered physical injuries in a car accident, then you must build a strong accident claim as quickly but thoroughly as you can. You don&#8217;t want to wait to build the claim and miss important evidence from the accident that disappears with time, but you also don&#8217;t want to rush the process and ultimately build a weak claim that doesn&#8217;t lead to full compensation.
Make sure you understand all of the types of compensation that you may deserve and use high-quality legal resources when building your claim.
Tangible losses
Many of the losses that car accidents cause are self-evident. A victim may suffer broken bones and other serious injuries that require extensive surgeries and therapy to repair, while at the same time the victim may lose income or professional opportunities.
With all types of loss, it is important to gather as much evidence as possible to make the claim clear and strong. This means gathering medical documentation about related injuries and medical billing records, as well as pay stubs and bank statements to outline how the injury affects the victim&#8217;s finances.
It is important to consider not only medical expenses that a victim already faces, but also the ongoing cost of treatment to ensure that the victim makes a full recovery. If the victim suffers long term disability, it is wise to build a comprehensive picture of how this loss may affect them in the future.
Intangible losses
Other losses are just as real, but their exact impact on the victim is not easy to quantify. For instance, an accident may leave a victim with some form of disfigurement, which can adversely affect the victim in every area of their life.
Similarly, if the victim is married, then their spouse may claim loss of consortium, or loss of the benefits of marriage. As anyone in a committed relationship can tell you, a severely injured partner places enormous pressures on the relationship, while at the same time often creating distance between spouses. While these losses are not as easy to identify and understand as medical bills, they are real and deserve compensation.
Building your claim begins now
Don&#8217;t wait to begin building a strong claim that truly represents your losses if you experienced a serious car accident. The sooner you begin building your claim, the sooner you can focus your energies on recovering from the effects of the accident and getting back to your normal way of living.The post Car accident victims may deserve compensation for many losses first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>
