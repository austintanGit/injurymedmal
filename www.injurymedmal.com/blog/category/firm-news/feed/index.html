																<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last thing an Ohio family expects to hear when a young person leaves home to start a new job is that their loved one was killed in a tragic incident only weeks later. Nevertheless, this is the reality that the loved ones of a 22-year-old intern are facing after she was killed by an escaped lion at the zoo where she was working. The woman, a recent graduate of Indiana University, began her job at the North Carolina zoo only two weeks before the incident on Dec. 30, 2018.
The worker was participating in a routine cleaning of an animal facility at the Conservators Center zoo in Burlington, North Carolina. According to the zoo, she was part of a husbandry team working with a professional animal keeper to perform cleaning and maintenance on an enclosure. During the cleaning, the lions were to be kept in a locked space. However, one lion escaped from this area, coming into the enclosure during the cleaning and attacking and killing the intern. After the intern was killed, Caswell County sheriff&#8217;s deputies shot the lion, killing it.
In a statement, the zoo said that it was not aware of how the lion had escaped from the area or whether any negligence was involved. It announced that it would be closed to visitors until further notice. Conservators Center receives around 16,000 visitors every year to see its collection of over 80 animals, including 20 big cats such as lions, tigers and leopards.
When a loved one dies, the loss is always difficult; however, this is exacerbated if a person&#8217;s life was taken due to someone else&#8217;s negligent behavior, harmful actions or failure to maintain their property. Columbus, Ohio, wrongful death attorneys might help the family of a person killed because of someone else&#8217;s actions to seek compensation for their losses.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon is facing a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of a former employee. People in Ohio might be interested in the details of the case as it raises issues of employer negligence and discrimination. The complaint alleges that Amazon failed to provide benefits that were mandated by contract, including disability compensation. These failures led to the employee&#8217;s death, according to the plaintiffs. The employee, who was 53 years old, died of a heart attack. 
According to the complaint, the employee worked as a senior human resources business analyst for Amazon beginning in 2015. The next year, the employee disclosed to Amazon that he was HIV positive and had some other medical conditions that required him to change his clothes and use the restroom frequently. The employee asked for a leave of absence based on the short-term disability plan at Amazon. The plan would have entitled the employee to benefits. 
The company granted his request until May 2016, when it said there wasn&#8217;t enough medical proof to continue the benefits. The employee made several appeals to Amazon and asked for an arrangement whereby he could work from home, says the complaint, and Amazon denied his requests. The man&#8217;s attorney said he was not terminally ill but he did have medical issues. 
In a case where the negligence or wrongdoing leads to a person&#8217;s death, legal action may be warranted. Wrongful death attorneys might be able to help in such a case by gathering evidence, securing expert witness reports or otherwise preparing for trial. Legal counsel could identify parties who have liability or negotiate the terms of a monetary settlement.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[An Ohio judge dismissed Facebook from a lawsuit filed by the family of a man whose killer shot him and shared the video on the social media site. The victim&#8217;s family had accused Facebook of acting negligently for not spotting and then reporting the posted threats by the shooter. 
The shooter shared the video of himself shooting the 74-year-old man on a street in Cleveland. His video remained live on the site for around two hours, and it was shared and viewed millions of times during that period. A few days later, the shooter also shot and killed himself following a police chase in Pennsylvania. 
Despite the role of Facebook postings in the incident, a judge in Cleveland said that the social media giant couldn&#8217;t be held responsible for the murder. Lawyers for the tech company said that the man&#8217;s family did not show that Facebook could have screened and found the post from one of its billions of users. Facebook, they argued, didn&#8217;t have the ability to act quickly in a way that could have prevented the death of the retiree. 
Representatives of the family said that they were considering their options moving forward and may file an appeal in the case. While Facebook was dismissed from the case, the family&#8217;s lawsuit is going forward against the estate of the shooter himself. 
A wrongful death lawsuit can help loved ones seek justice and accountability. Spouses, children or parents of a deceased loved one can consult with a Columbus wrongful death attorney about how they can seek compensation.

The loss of a loved one is always difficult to handle, but when the loss occurred because of wrongful death, it can be nearly impossible to handle. When someone else&#8217;s negligence causes you to lose a loved one, you will want as many answers as possible. This might not be feasible right away, which means you will have to learn how to deal with the loss as best as you can.
The grieving process will be much longer and more painful if you continue to live in denial after the loss of a loved one. It&#8217;s easier said than done, but you must acknowledge the loss in order to begin the recovery process.
You, and others close to you, should seek professional support. Meeting with a therapist on a regular basis following the wrongful death of a loved one can move the grieving process along. You will be guided through your grief and emotions by someone who is properly trained to help you.
Another good idea is to join a support group. This is much different from seeking therapy. The support group will consist of others in a similar position to you. All of the group members will be able to speak about their situation, which could help you understand your feelings and provide tips on how to cope with the loss.
Do your best to celebrate the life of your loved one. This can be done in various ways, including donating to a favorite charity of the loved one, naming a child after the loved one and much more.
If you have lost a loved one due to wrongful death, it&#8217;s best to speak with an experienced personal injury attorney in Ohio.

The loss of a loved one in a tragic accident can lead to several different impacts on your life. The emotional impact is one of the most serious impacts because this is something that can affect every aspect of your life.
Feeling grief after you lose a loved one is a normal reaction. The issue comes in when you can&#8217;t ever move past that negative feeling. It is understandable that your life isn&#8217;t ever going to go back to the normal life that you knew before the fatal crash.
You also have to think about the financial impact that your loved one&#8217;s death has on your life. This is something that is very important because some of the expenses will come up right away. For example, you will have to pay for the funeral expenses for your loved one.
If the person who passed away was the income earner for the home, you might find that you are also facing some issues with regular life bills. This loss of the income that you counted on to survive could be devastating.
You do have an option that might help you recover some of the money that you are missing out on. This isn&#8217;t going to take away the emotional pain, but it might help to reduce the stress that you feel because of the finances.
We can help you learn about filing a wrongful death lawsuit. There are specific requirements in Ohio for this, so we can help you to make sure that things are being handled properly. Don&#8217;t waste too much time taking action as there is a time limit for filing this type of compensation claim.The post Take action if you lose a loved one in an accident first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

The family of a 77-year-old Franklin County man that was struck and killed in a car crash in July of 2015 has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against both the Franklin County Sheriff&#8217;s Office and the officer alleged to have been responsible for his death. The officer is believed to have been responding to a call to backup another officer immediately prior to striking the man&#8217;s car.
The police report prepared in this case highlights how the deputy sheriff in this instance drove his police car at speeds in excess of 100 mph. He had been called to back up another deputy who had detained a drunk driver right outside of Columbus at the time. Somewhere along his way, he collided with the decedent&#8217;s van, causing an impact that resulted in the man being ejected from his vehicle.
Prosecutors with the Franklin County District Attorney&#8217;s Office reviewed the case, but ultimately decided to not file criminal charges against the officer for the man&#8217;s death.
The decedent&#8217;s brother, who brought the wrongful death lawsuit, maintains that the officer not only drove his car at an excessive rate of speed, but did so without proper supervision. He maintains that his brother&#8217;s death was completely avoidable.
In this instance, the burden of proof falls on the decedent&#8217;s family members to show that the officer was negligent or reckless in the moments leading up to the man&#8217;s death. If the family and their Columbus wrongful death attorney are successful in doing that, then they may be able to recover funeral costs as well as other wrongful death damages in this case.

Have you lost a loved one because of another person&#8217;s actions or inaction? Did he or she pass away from injuries suffered in a slip-and-fall accident at a local store, a motor vehicle crash or a failure to diagnose by a physician? Have you thought about seeking compensation from the person responsible for your loved one&#8217;s death?
At Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC, we know how devastating it can be to lose someone you love because of someone else&#8217;s recklessness, carelessness or negligence. We help the families of those who have died seek compensation for a variety of damages, including medical expenses, pain and suffering, final expenses and more. If you win a judgment in a wrongful death case, how do you collect it?
While we can help you collect the judgment, there are a couple of things you should remember. If the person responsible for the accident that caused your loved one his or her injuries does not have insurance or the financial means to pay the judgment, chances are that you will not collect it. If, however, the person responsible is tennis great Venus Williams, chances are pretty good that she has deep enough pockets to handle it.
Just a few days ago, the police determined that Williams was at fault in a car crash that resulted in the death of the other driver. With her net worth estimated at $75 million, it is very likely that there are enough assets to cover a judgment.
If your loved one has been killed and you want to file a wrongful death lawsuit, your attorney can provide more information and guidance on your legal options. We also have more information on our web pages dealing with wrongful death and fatal accidents.The post Collecting a judgment in a wrongful death case first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

A fatal car crash that claimed the life of unidentified Toyota driver in the early morning hours of Thursday, May 11, 2017 is under investigation by the Columbus Police Department. A preliminary investigation into the accident seems to point to the driver of the other unidentified vehicle as having crossed the center line into the westbound one. This resulted in a head-on collision with the deceased.
The accident occurred at approximately 3:39 a.m. The 33-year-old and his 32-year-old passenger were riding eastbound along East 11th Avenue near its intersection with Ohlen Avenue at the time. It&#8217;s believed that the unidentified Toyota driver died right away as a result of the impact.
As for other two men, they were both transported from the scene to Grant Medical Center. They were listed as having been in stable condition upon their arrival there. It&#8217;s there that the driver of the car that crossed into oncoming traffic had his blood drawn so that toxicology tests could be run.
Police are awaiting the results of those tests before deciding whether or not the man will face any criminal charges for his role in causing the fatal car crash. Even if police don&#8217;t file charges, the man could held civilly liable for having crossed the line into oncoming traffic resulting in this man&#8217;s death.
If you have a loved one that has been killed as a result of his or her involvement in an auto accident, then you might be entitled to reimbursement of funeral costs and other damages. To better understand what your rights are, you may wish to seek out the guidance of a Columbus, Ohio wrongful death attorney.

Lake Hospital System has been named as a defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit by the wife of a patient who died from acute intoxication from opioids and benzodiazepines. The prescribing doctor, an occupational medicine specialist, is also named as a defendant.
The lawsuit, which was filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, seeks unspecified damages in a jury trial for funeral and burial expenses, loss of support, mental anguish and loss of prospective inheritance. Her attorney believes that &#8220;this is a multimillion dollar case.&#8221;
In 2010, the woman&#8217;s husband suffered a back injury at work. He was treated at the LakeHealth emergency room in Willoughby. The physician prescribed opiates to the man, and according to the woman&#8217;s attorney, for too long of a time and did not spot or treat the man&#8217;s signs of addiction.
Lake Hospital System, Inc., according to the lawsuit, did not &#8220;recognize a rampant prescription overdose crisis&#8221; in Ohio. As a result, Lake Hospital System, Inc. failed to create and implement proper opiate prescribing procedures for its employees and agents.&#8221; In addition, the attorney says that the hospital system should have realized that the physician was not experienced in &#8220;pain management prescribing knowledge.&#8221;
The man was on prescription opiates for five years. The physician doesn&#8217;t work for the medical system any longer, but is now the director of laboratory services for Signature Health.
Wrongful death lawsuits allow family members to hold people and entities responsible for someone&#8217;s death due to negligence. An attorney experienced in such cases can provide you with more information on wrongful death lawsuits.
