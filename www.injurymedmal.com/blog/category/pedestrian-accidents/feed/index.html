																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whether you ride to work, for fun, to reduce your carbon footprint or for exercise, bicycling can be a great alternative to driving in Columbus. Despite its health and environmental benefits, bicycling presents dangers especially when bikers and motorists have to share the road together. What rules should bicyclists and motorists follow so that everyone can reach their destination safely?
Rules for bicyclists on the road
One big rule for bicyclists is to be predictable. This means traveling in the same direction as traffic and riding in bike lanes if there are bike lanes present. Biking on the sidewalk can make it harder for motorists to see you, and sometimes sidewalks end abruptly forcing the bicyclist to ride into traffic. Bicyclists should also signal before turning, and they should look behind them briefly before changing lanes or executing a turn. Bicyclists may want to consider taking a safe riding class. And bicyclists should always make sure to wear a helmet when riding.
Rules for motorists sharing the road with bicyclists
Motorists also have rules to follow when sharing the road with bicyclists. Motorists must yield to a bicyclistâ€™s right of way when necessary to avoid turning in front of the bicyclist and causing an accident. Motorists should make sure they pay attention when reversing, especially in parking lots as there may be bicyclists behind them. At intersections motorists should come to a complete stop and look both ways for any bicyclists approaching them. Motorists should avoid speeding and drive defensively.
Take action if you are involved in a bicycle accident
If you are struck by a car while riding your bicycle you could be seriously injured. When this happens, you may want to learn more about negligence lawsuits. Simply put, motorists have a duty to drive with due care. If they breach this duty by striking a bicyclist, causing injuries that would not have happened but for the crash, the injured bicyclist may be able to hold the negligent motorist accountable.The post How to share the road safely with bicyclists first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ohio law clearly states that when a driver gets into an auto accident, they must remain at the scene. This is especially important when a driver strikes a pedestrian because their life could be hanging in the balance.
Any car accident has the potential to leave somebody involved seriously injured. But pedestrians are especially vulnerable to the force of impact from a multi-ton car, truck or SUV. A pedestrian lying on the road after getting hit by a motorist may not be able to get themselves out of traffic, let alone call themselves an ambulance.
The driver&#8217;s legal responsibilities
Therefore, Ohio law requires drivers involved in pedestrian accidents to remain at the scene until police or emergency medical services arrive or exchange information with the other party if the party is conscious and able to comprehend. This is a criminal statute. A driver who commits a hit and run on a pedestrian could be arrested and charged with at least a first-degree misdemeanor. If the victim was seriously hurt when the driver fled, the driver could face a felony of up to the second degree.
Why does this matter?
Abandoning a pedestrian who is seriously hurt can have terrible consequences. If they get immediate medical attention, their injuries might be contained and heal more quickly. But if the driver fails to stay at the scene and call 911, there might be nobody else to make the call. The victim could be unconscious, disoriented, or in too much pain to use their phone. It could be several minutes until someone else happens upon them and calls for an ambulance. In those minutes, the victim could lose their life.
A negligent driver&#8217;s choices can have serious consequences. Later, the driver&#8217;s victim (or their next of kin) can choose to take action in civil court.The post When the driver must stay at the scene of a pedestrian accident in Ohio first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

									<description><![CDATA[<p>The number of serious accidents involving pedestrians is on the rise in the state, according to a recent study from the Ohio Department of Transportation. During the study&#8217;s 10-year-period of 2009 to 2018, Ohio had 6,174 serious accidents involving pedestrians, with nearly 18 percent being fatal. This amounts to 612 fatal accidents each year.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[The number of serious accidents involving pedestrians is on the rise in the state, according to a recent study from the Ohio Department of Transportation.
During the study&#8217;s 10-year-period of 2009 to 2018, Ohio had 6,174 serious accidents involving pedestrians, with nearly 18 percent being fatal. This amounts to 612 fatal accidents each year.
The report noted that 134 pedestrians died on state roads in 2018, about a 5 percent drop from the 141 pedestrian fatalities reported in 2017.
Columbus, Cincinnati are at the top
Columbus ranked first in the state for having the highest number of serious pedestrian accidents. The city reported an average of 73 pedestrian accidents per year. However, Cincinnati ranked first for the highest crash rate per population with 17.3, as well as having the highest crash density per square mile.
The counties with the highest number of serious pedestrian crashes per 100,000 residents were: Hamilton (9.6); Lucas (8.4); Franklin (7.9); Montgomery (7.9); and Scioto (7.2).
More from the ODOT report
Here are other findings from the ODOT report.

The 15-25 age group accounts for 23 percent of pedestrians in serious injury crashes, but the age group represents only 13 percent of Ohio&#8217;s population.
Sixty-seven percent of fatal crashes and 62 percent of serious injury crashes involved male pedestrians.
There was an increase in crashes during dusk/dark hours in the fall and winter months.

On a more positive note, the report said Ohio had the 11th-lowest pedestrian fatality rate per population of all 50 states.
The usual suspects
Contributing factors to many of these accidents are a roguesâ€™ gallery of reasons, such as drunk driving, speeding, distracted driving, and reckless driving. Pedestrians must be alert and aware of any potential threats. If you have questions about accidents involving pedestrians, contact an attorney who is experienced in this area of the law.The post Pedestrian accidents on the rise in Ohio, study says first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>
