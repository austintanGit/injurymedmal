																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Medical facilities and health care professionals pride themselves on diagnosing conditions and treating injuries. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for doctors and nurses to adopt a singular focus in terms of an illness and miss the onset of dangerous conditions. This level of negligence or inattention can lead to serious health complications.
A patient who remains in the same position for extended periods of time can develop the progressive skin condition known as bed sores. While many people equate the onset of bedsores with nursing home residents who are confined to a wheelchair or bed, these pressure sores can develop on the skin under numerous conditions. A medical staff must ensure not only the proper hydration of patients but that they are continuously moved to reduce or eliminate the pressure on certain body parts.
What are bed sores?
Bed sores, also called decubitus ulcers, develop after prolonged periods of pressure against the skin. These sores often affect areas of the body that have little muscle or tissue separating the skin from the bones such as the heels, hips, shoulder blades or tailbone. Without the proper care and attention, the condition can quickly progress through numerous stages of severity including skin damage, tenderness, cellulitis, bone infections and sepsis. An infection can quickly spread through the blood to numerous vital organs leading to severe complications.
After a serious surgery or a medical condition that challenges mobility, a hospital patient faces the risk of developing bedsores. Even with doctors, nurses and techs coming in and out of the hospital room, patients must receive the proper care necessary to prevent this devastating condition.
Far from an isolated complication, bed sores can impact thousands of hospital patients each year. What might seem at first like a minor skin condition can quickly progress to damage muscles and bones – often requiring amputation.The post Can you develop bed sores during a hospital stay? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we have a medical emergency in our life, we trust in medical professionals to apply their experience, education and sound judgment towards helping us to overcome the adverse effects of our condition. This is especially true in the emergency room, where time is often of the essence for treating dangerous injuries.
Sometimes, unfortunately, doctors and other emergency room personnel make mistakes that can have horrific consequences for the injured person – such as when they discharge someone too early without performing an adequate examination. When can a hospital or doctor be legally accountable for increased injuries that result from a premature emergency room discharge?
What constitutes medical malpractice?
Doctors and other medical professionals have a minimum standard of care that they must always comply with when assisting patients. Medical malpractice is when a doctor negligently deviates from this standard of care, resulting in harm to a patient that could have been avoided if the doctor had behaved as they should have.
When courts must decide whether a particular doctor’s conduct constitutes malpractice, they compare that doctor’s actions with the actions of a hypothetical average and reasonable doctor in their field. If the average doctor would have done something (or refrained from doing something) in a particular situation, then it could be malpractice to deviate from that course of action, especially if doing so harms the patient.
When is premature emergency room discharge malpractice?
Applying this standard to the context of emergency room visits, it could be malpractice for an E.R. doctor to discharge someone before the average doctor would agree that it is safe to do so.
For example, you might be showing signs of a severe bacterial infection, internal bleeding or some other problem that practically any other doctor would recognize, but your E.R. staff failed to catch it and sent you home prematurely, which caused your condition to become much worse.
It’s important to note, however, that just because you suffer from an adverse effect from premature discharge from the E.R. does not necessarily mean that there was medical malpractice involved. The doctor’s decision to discharge you must have been the actual cause of your injury getting worse.
Medical malpractice comes in many forms, and it can cause a great deal of unnecessary suffering. Fortunately, our justice system offers recourses to victims of the negligence of medical personnel.The post Can premature discharge from an emergency room be medical malpractice? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Few bonds of trust are stronger than what patients have with their doctors. Suffering illness or injury creates uncertainty and stress during perilous times. Going to a medical professional should represent the first step in clarifying specific problems, if not recovery.
The Indian Health Service (IHS) is an agency serving as the primary federal health care provider and advocate for American Indians and Alaska natives. The group’s mission is to provide medical services to all 2.6 million members of 563 federal recognized tribes throughout 36 states, including Ohio. Their mission is simple: to offer the best care possible.
The Growing Problem of Substandard Native American Health Care
Recent news seems to undermine that mission. According to a Wall Street Journal investigation, IHS has become well known for giving “second chances” to doctors with troubling histories of malpractice allegations that resulted in permanent suspensions and potentially career-ending regulatory sanctions.
After five malpractice settlements, one doctor hired by IHS had previously received a permanent suspension from the facility where he practiced most of his career. The ban was based on findings of “multiple serious deficits in judgment.”
By turning to the IHS, he was able to resume his career. Following five additional malpractice settlements totaling $1.8 million, including two fatalities, the doctor retired.
That quintet of complaints only scratches the surface of the 163 malpractice claims examined, with 40 percent resulting in death. Of the doctors hired by IHS, 25 percent of those recruited should have sounded some type of alert after reviewing their respective applications.
To put this calamity into perspective, insurance actuaries determined that doctors in the United States will have one malpractice claim every 20 years. Surgeons would likely have two during the same period.
IHS saw merit in some physicians who had 10 in the last decade.
Admittedly, recruitment is a challenge for any medical facility. In May of last year, the IHS had a vacancy rate of just under 30 percent. Remote locations and lower pay present hiring. However, lowering standards and failing to secure all information in background checks have a more cataclysmic effect on the health of Native American communities throughout the country.The post Second Chances Undermining Medical Services first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Doctors and nurses are highly educated and trained professionals. It takes years, sometimes even decades, for them to become established in their field. This leads some people to believe that these medical professionals are so skilled that they rarely make mistakes. If you’re reading this blog, though, then you probably know all too well that the truth is far different.
Doctors and nurses are human, which means that they’re accident prone and susceptible to burnout. The tragic reality is that these characteristics can have tremendous ramifications for unsuspecting patients, oftentimes leaving them seriously inured or, in the worst cases, deceased. This is troublesome, to say the least, especially given that some studies say as many as 50% of physicians and surgeons experience burnout.
How burnout happens in the medical field
Doctors and nurses face many of the same stressors that the rest of us face in our professions. Here are some of the biggest contributors:

Time constraints: Medical professionals often have packed schedules. This means that any delays can throw their schedules out of line and force them to work long days. Sadly, this means that these medical professionals often end up devoting less time to patients than they would like, which can lead to rushed care and missed opportunities for diagnosis and treatment. In fact, one study found that one-third of physicians reported needing 50% more time to be able to conduct appropriately thorough physical examinations. Half of physicians surveyed in that study indicated feeling time pressures when conducting these examinations.
Chaotic environment: The medical field is fast paced, for sure, but it isn’t always well organized, either. Unexpected issues can arise during surgery and distractions can easily draw a tired doctor or nurse’s attention away from a patient when it is desperately needed. This can lead to serious and harmful errors being made.
Electronic medical records: With HIPPA came the use of electronic medical records. A lot of doctors think that these records are time-consuming and interfere with face-to-face contact with patients. Many of these doctors feel that the bureaucracy involved in dealing with electronic medical records makes them like a cog in the wheel rather than the frontline healthcare provider they hoped to be. The use of these records draws time away from patients, which can lead to medical mistakes.
Personal responsibilities: Being a medical professional can be stressful. But these individuals don’t just have to deal with the stress of managing others’ healthcare; they also have to cope with the pressures placed upon them in their personal lives. This could involve childcare, marital problems, and even issues pertaining to substance abuse. This pressure can compound with work-related stress to drive burnout and lead to poor outcomes for patients.

What can be done to prevent burnout?
No one wants to have a burned out doctor treat him or her. That’s why some in the medical field are calling for change. They seek to provide medical professionals with more flexible schedules and assistance in electronic medical record entries so that they can spend more time with patients. They also hope to give doctors a better work-life balance so that they can stay fresh and energized while on the job. That being said, the current state of affairs falls far short of the ideal.
Hold errant medical professionals accountable
We understand that burnout is real in every profession. Yet, not every profession has individuals’ health, wellbeing, and their very lives at stake. That’s why burnout is no excuse for medical mistakes that leave innocent patients harmed. If you or a loved one has been harmed by what you suspect to be medical malpractice, then now may be the time to reach out to a legal team that knows how to hold negligent medical professionals and their employers accountable.The post How doctor burnout occurs, leaving patients in the crosshairs first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[You may like to watch hospital dramas on television. You enjoy watching simulations of doctors assessing a patient’s symptoms and responding to emergency room situations. However, most likely you don’t like the idea of ending up in an emergency room yourself. You know that if you need emergency room medical care something could be seriously wrong and even endanger your life.
What you may not realize is that medical care can go wrong in an emergency room too. Sometimes, patients don’t receive adequate care or doctors discharge them before they discover a correct medical diagnosis. In a 2019 survey, 76% of emergency room physicians surveyed reported they had been sued by a patient for medical malpractice. Also, about half of medical malpractice injuries occur because of errors in the emergency room.
Medical malpractice in the emergency room
Some of the errors that can lead to medical malpractice in the emergency room include a healthcare provider:

Failing to take an accurate medical history of a patient
Failing to give a patient a thorough examination
Failing to run the proper tests or x-rays to provide proper care for a patient
Failing to rule out possible life-threatening conditions
Failing to properly monitor a patient
Discharging a patient without fully treating their illness
Making surgical errors

Some illnesses that often are misdiagnosed in an emergency room can lead to lifelong harm for a patient or even premature death. For example, if an ER doctor doesn’t correctly diagnose a stroke in a patient, that patient may end up partially paralyzed or face a long, difficult recovery because they didn’t receive the right medication quickly.
In order for a patient to prove a successful medical malpractice claim, they must show that:

There was a doctor-patient relationship.
The emergency room physician provided negligent care.
The patient was harmed because of that negligent care.

Medical malpractice compensation
Patients who receive a medical malpractice settlement or win a medical malpractice lawsuit can receive compensation for:

Past and future medical bills
Pain and suffering and reduction in quality of life
Lost wages or reduced wages because of their suffering or a lifelong disability because of medical malpractice
Punitive damages (to punish a physician for providing negligent care)

If you believe you or a loved one suffered because of negligent care during an emergency room visit, you should consult an experienced attorney. An attorney can mount evidence for your medical malpractice claim and help hold a care provider accountable for the mistakes that impacted your health.The post When care goes wrong in an emergency room first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When you need hospital care or a surgery at a hospital, you likely are most concerned about when your health may improve. You may worry about experiencing complications from surgery or if your treatment will be successful. However, you may not think about a more serious problem: if you experience medical malpractice under hospital care.
Yet, healthcare providers make mistakes. A nurse could miscount the number of sponges a doctor inserted in you during surgery. Then, you discover after surgery, you still have a surgical sponge in your body. Or a doctor fails to give you a CT scan, even after you sought ER care because of a car accident and you later discover you are bleeding internally. Or the hospital pharmacy doesn’t give you the correct medication. If any such error seriously impacts your health or causes you additional harm, you could have a medical malpractice claim.
Medical malpractice: Holding hospitals accountable
In Ohio, victims of medical malpractice can sue hospitals for negligent care from hospital employees, including:

Doctors
Surgeons
Nurses
Residents
Pharmacists
Hospital administrators

Providing negligent care goes beyond making surgical or diagnostic mistakes or not providing a patient proper treatment. Patients also can receive negligent care if a care provider:

Doesn’t supervise a patient properly
Doesn’t respond to a patient’s serious complaint
Doesn’t inform a doctor of a patient’s signs of injury or distress
Doesn’t supervise a resident in training properly
Doesn’t practice standard disinfecting or cleaning procedures

Patients can sue hospital administrators if they were negligent in their staff hiring, staff training, staff supervision or failing to fire a care provider who committed malpractice in the past.
When you receive negligent care
If you feel you received negligent care during a recent hospital stay, you should consult a medical malpractice attorney. You may receive damages for any serious injuries or long-term complications you experienced because of medical malpractice. You also need to keep all your medical records, record if you need to take time off work or incur other expenses because of the negligent care you received. This documentation will help establish what level of damages you may receive.
Sometimes, you have to hold hospitals accountable, especially if negligent care impacted your long-term health. You deserve to get compensation for any costs you incurred because of your negligent care and you can help ensure that a hospital takes steps to improve their patient care.The post When can patients sue Ohio hospitals for malpractice? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When people seek medical help, they should never have to worry that medical staff will do more harm than good. While most doctors and nurses practice excellent medicine, malpractice does occur. Why does medical malpractice injure so many people? Can anything be done to prevent it from happening?
In this post, we will look at top reasons for medical malpractice litigation.
Surgical mistakes
A patient&#8217;s body is vulnerable during surgery and a lot can go wrong. A small slip of the scalpel is enough to cause hemorrhaging, permanent muscle damage, or infection. More lawsuits are filed against surgeons than any other type of physician. In fact, half of all surgeons have been sued more than once.
Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis
If a doctor fails to accurately diagnose an injury or illness, a patient can receive treatment that makes the true problem worse. A delay in treatment can significantly worsen outcomes – and even result in death.
Test failures
When testing equipment does not work properly or does not provide accurate information, it can jeopardize the health of anyone it tests. Medical staff needs to check equipment regularly to ensure that test results are accurate.
Lack of information
Doctors need to properly inform their patients about their condition and any medical decisions they may need to make. When patients do not understand the risks of medication or treatment, they may not be ready to suffer the lifelong consequences of their choices. This lack of information can lead to patients suing doctors for not telling them about all risks and options. This is called lack of informed consent.
General neglect
When medical staff works on the same types of cases day in and day out, they can become complacent and make simple mistakes such as not double-checking crucial information such as medication dosages. No one should suffer lifelong consequences because someone took a shortcut in their job.The post Top reasons for medical malpractice lawsuits first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rare cancers present unique difficulties for medical professionals, but that does not mean they can&#8217;t be properly treated. Medical malpractice law holds doctors and other health care professionals in Ohio to a professional standard of care. With rare cancers, there may be an increased risk of misdiagnosis, limited treatment options and a limited number of specialists available. Most of the data about especially rare types of cancer comes from individual case studies because there are not enough patients for larger group studies or clinical trials.
One growing trend in the treatment of rare cancers is to focus on the mutations that the cancers come from rather than the part of the body in which they originate. Several drugs have been approved to treat mismatch repair deficiency cancers in which the tumor has problems making repairs to itself once it has been damaged. A rare muscle tumor cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, and a rare pancreatic cancer, acinar cell sarcoma, are both mismatch repair deficiency cancers as are a number of more prevalent prostate, colorectal, bladder and breast cancers.
The treatment of rare cancers is also dependent on smaller biotech companies, which are more likely to develop niche drugs. The Food and Drug Administration provides incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs that are likely to be effective for smaller patient populations. Proper medical treatment of rare diseases in many cases requires a knowledge of uncommon drugs.
People in California who have suffered initial misdiagnosis or other medical errors may be entitled to compensation. Damages may include pain and suffering, medical expenses and lost wages. A lawyer who practices medical malpractice law might be able to help injured parties by gathering medical evidence or interviewing witnesses to build a case for trial. Columbus, Ohio, medical malpractice injury lawyers might be able to secure expert testimony via deposition or negotiate settlement with at-fault parties and their malpractice insurance companies.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[The vision many Ohio residents have of medical malpractice is not a pretty one. The thought of a botched surgery often comes vividly to mind. However, surgical errors are among the least common types of medical malpractice mistakes committed by doctors and other medical professionals. 
Instead, legal commentators point to misdiagnosis as a leading cause of medical malpractice. Misdiagnosis can lead to patient injury in several different ways. The wrong medicine or the wrong dosage may be prescribed, the wrong treatment protocol could be initiated or proper treatment might be delayed or not started at all. It&#8217;s important to understand that medical malpractice can be an error of commission, where a mistake is affirmatively made, or an act of omission, where something that&#8217;s needed is not done. 
Further complicating the level of proof needed for a malpractice case to proceed, it&#8217;s insufficient to simply prove a medical error was made that a medical professional of average standing would have avoided under similar conditions. It&#8217;s also necessary to prove the damages sustained by the patient would not have occurred but for the error. For example, say a patient&#8217;s cancer went undiagnosed for three months, and then proper treatment was administered, but the patient unfortunately died. If it can be shown that the condition was a particularly aggressive form of cancer, and the patient would have died even had treatment started immediately, there might be no malpractice. 
The degree of proof needed in medical malpractice cases is substantial and the defenses are typically very assertive. An experienced medical malpractice lawyer can help determine if a particular case has merit.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When people in Ohio go to a doctor for their painful symptoms, they expect to receive a correct diagnosis. Vasculitis is one condition that can be dangerous. The inflammation of blood vessels can destroy arteries and veins, and the disorder can be painful and serious, leading to damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and other major organs. Therefore, many physicians want to begin treatment as quickly as possible when vasculitis is diagnosed in order to prevent further damage. However, quick treatment can lead to major problems when a misdiagnosis is involved. 
Experts warn that there are other disorders that can be commonly mistaken for vasculitis due to certain common symptoms. However, the main treatment for vasculitis, beginning with high doses of corticosteroids, can make these other illnesses even more dangerous. For example, vasculitis can accompany cases of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the symptoms of endocarditis can also resemble many of the same symptoms. One patient was started on a steroids regime before all of her lab results were in. As a result of this misdiagnosis, she suffered a stroke and permanent disabilities without receiving effective treatment for her actual disorder. 
There are a number of causes of vasculitis. It can develop along with some types of cancer, rheumatic diseases and auto-immune disorders and infections like varicella or hepatitis C. However, vasculitis can also result from some side effects of both prescribed and recreational drugs. The correct treatment can vary depending on the cause of the disorder, and the wrong treatment can be harmful. 
Medical errors can lead to seriously damaged health and lifelong disabilities. People who are suffering as a result of a doctor error can work with Columbus, Ohio, medical malpractice injury lawyers to pursue compensation for their pain and suffering, lost wages, medical bills and other damages.
