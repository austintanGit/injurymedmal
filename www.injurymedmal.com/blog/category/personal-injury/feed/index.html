																<content:encoded><![CDATA[After an accident that causes a personal injury, victims may want to make a claim against the at-fault party. Accident victims may be surprised to learn there is a limit on the amount of money that a victim can receive for compensation for damages. This limit is known as a “damage cap.”
Ohio law limits the compensation someone can receive from an accident. In this post, we will look at how much those limits are.
What exactly is a damage cap?
A damage cap is a law that places a maximum payout on a claim for personal injury. Ohio law says a victim&#8217;s damages &#8220;shall not exceed the greater of $250,000 or an amount that is equal to three times the economic loss.&#8221; Economic loss usually consists of medical bills and lost wages from missing employment due to being injured.
Non-economic damages cannot be more than $350,000 for an individual. Non-economic damages are more commonly referred to as compensation for “pain and suffering.”
There are exceptions, however. State law in Ohio says the noneconomic cap does not apply to compensation if someone has sustained an injury which includes:

Permanent and substantial physical deformity, loss of use of a limb, or loss of a bodily organ system, or
Permanent physical functional injury that permanently prevents the injured person from being able to independently care for self and perform life-sustaining activities

When determining this dollar amount, the law says courts cannot consider:

Evidence of a defendant&#8217;s alleged wrongdoing, misconduct, or guilt
Evidence of a defendant&#8217;s wealth or financial resources
Evidence that is offered for the purpose of punishing the defendant

The current Ohio law went into effect in 2005.
Do you have questions?
If you have questions about this issue, contact an experienced Ohio personal injury attorney.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a new mother, you will want to protect your child from harm at all costs. If you have already noticed that your baby is not developing or progressing as they should, you will want to know why, so that their issues can be dealt with as quickly as possible. One of the most common causes of delayed physical and mental development among young children is, sadly, preventable birth injuries.
Birth injuries count as any type of injury that occurs during the process of delivering a child. In most cases of birth injuries, the baby was completely healthy in the womb. Complications arising during delivery can cause the child to suffer from life-altering injuries, and, in many cases, these situations occur due to midwife negligence. It is important that you understand the common reasons why birth injuries occur, and how midwife negligence can play a role.
The most common types of birth injuries
Long labors carry a high risk of complications. This is why medical professionals often opt to carry out a Caesarean section when the labor is taking too long. Labors over 18 hours can cause pressure on the child&#8217;s brain and can cause their blood pressure to become too high.
Oxygen deprivation is another risk factor for babies. If infants are being deprived of oxygen during the labor, they may suffer from learning difficulties for the rest of their lives.
The way that medical professionals react to emergencies and complications is key to birth injury prevention. Sadly, sometimes poor decisions are made that are in favor of convenience rather than the safety of the mother and child. These cases are often taken to court, and, when successful, damages can be claimed.
Recognizing midwife negligence
If you believe that the way your midwife acted during your labor led to birth injuries, you may be able to take legal action. If you can show that your midwife acted without your best interests in mind, and if you can show that their behavior led to damages, you have a good chance of being successful.
It is important that you do not tolerate unprofessional behavior by medical providers. By taking action to assert your rights, you may be preventing others from suffering in the same way.The post Your baby may be suffering due to midwife negligence first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Being in a car wreck, especially one that occurs at high speeds or that involves a semitruck, can lead to devastating injuries. The violent impact of these crashes can damage the spinal cord, which may cause life-threatening effects.
Unfortunately, a spinal cord injury isn&#8217;t one that you can always heal from. There are a lot of factors that go into whether recovery is possible. It is imperative that each patient learns about the factors in their case so they can make informed decisions about necessary care.
Injury location 
The location of the injury has a significant impact on what parts of the body are affected. The areas that are affected are always lower than the location of the injury. This means that an injury to the neck can affect the upper limbs, lower limbs and abdomen. An injury to the lower back wouldn&#8217;t impact the upper limbs, but it would affect the lower limbs.
Injuries to the neck are particularly problematic. When the injury is at the C3 level or higher, there is a chance that the person will be dependent upon a ventilator. They won&#8217;t be able to use their arms or legs, so mobility can be a concern.
Severity of the injury
The severity of a spinal cord injury is classified into two types – complete and incomplete. In a complete injury, the person has no feeling in the area below the injury. They also don&#8217;t have any function in it. In an incomplete injury, they have limited sensation or function.
Typically, incomplete injuries are associated with greater recovery than complete injuries. It can take a lot of time for progress to be made; however, patients usually start to see limited progress in the initial days and weeks after the accident as inflammation begins to abate.
Life after the injury
A patient who has a spinal cord injury that produces life-long results will need a lot of care and other assistance in the future. This can be costly, so they have to think about ways to minimize those expenses. For some, the answer is to file a personal injury claim that allows them to seek compensation from the driver in Ohio who struck them. They will have to estimate an appropriate sum for damages. They need to be able to cover past medical bills and future ones, so determining the amount to seek can be complex.The post Spinal cord injuries can produce serious life changes first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alcohol is almost ubiquitous in modern college culture. As a parent sending a child off to attend college, you no doubt knew about the potential risks of alcohol for your child. Chances are good that you probably tried to have a very awkward conversation with your soon-to-be college student about the potential risks of alcohol. However, you&#8217;ll have little influence on your child once they&#8217;re on campus.
From the dangers of driving drunk to issues involving consent after drinking, there are many concerns that young adults may not think of when they decide to drink. Sadly, no matter how diligent you are in regard to educating your child about social dangers, you can&#8217;t be there to make important decisions for them.
Beyond the risks of legal and educational consequences, it is possible for your child to wind up severely hurt while intoxicated. In that situation, you may need to look into who is liable for the injuries your child suffered.
Alcohol can cause all kinds of injuries, especially for new users
When people think about alcohol-related injuries, their minds almost always go first to drunk driving accidents. There is no question that alcohol contributes substantially to a large number of collisions in the United States every year.
Teaching your kid not to drive drunk only protects them from making a bad decision. It doesn&#8217;t protect them from all the other people near campus who are over indulging in alcohol and still driving. If a drunk driver hurts your child, the chances are good that you can take legal action against the driver involved. However, car crashes are not the only kind of accidents that involve alcohol.
If someone serves your child too much alcohol, your kid could wind up hurt just while walking home in Columbus. Injuries related to over-intoxication, including alcohol poisoning, which can prove fatal, may be the responsibility of the person serving the alcohol. This is particularly true in the case of someone 21 or older deciding to provide alcohol to someone who has not yet reached the legal drinking age. Younger drinkers may not know their limits.
Alcohol injuries may have lasting consequences
The injuries from a car crash can cause lifelong pain and disability. Over-intoxication can also have staggering consequences. Alcohol can cause a wide range of poisoning symptoms, from damage to the eyes and liver to actual brain damage. It can also drastically increase someone&#8217;s risks of certain kinds of cancer.
Your family may struggle to deal with the medical consequences of an alcohol-related injury, particularly if your child suffered catastrophic injuries. Sitting down with a personal injury attorney can help you explore what choices you can make to alleviate the strain an alcohol-related injury has caused your college student.The post Who’s responsible for your child’s college alcohol injury? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[For many people in Ohio, few things really capture the fun of summer like a backyard swimming pool. You have probably spent countless hours sitting in the sun, sipping a cold drink, listening to music and watching the children splash and play. It&#8217;s relaxing and refreshing. You always feel a bit let down when it&#8217;s time to close the pool at the end of the season, but you feel elated when you get to open it again and you know summer has really arrived.
That said, swimming pools have inherent dangers. Every year, young children fall into them and suffer serious injuries or even pass away. This can happen to your own kids, your neighbors&#8217; kids, friends who come over to play with your children or just other kids from the area who see the pool and decide to take a closer look.
That&#8217;s why homeowners have a responsibility to make these spaces as safe as possible. They need to understand that children may not know how to swim and that very young kids do not make rational decisions. They honestly do not understand the serious risks. They make mistakes. It&#8217;s up to adults to keep them safe.
With that in mind, here are a few requirements for swimming pool fences:
1. The fence has to completely enclose the pool
A fence along one side of the property is not enough. It has to completely block off the pool so that there is no way to get to it without passing through the house or a gate &#8212; or climbing the fence. Homeowners do have a choice. Some opt to fence in the whole property or the entire yard. Others opt to fence in just the pool itself, along with the pool deck. Either option is fine, so long as the fence completely surrounds the pool.
2. The fence needs a locking gate
A gate without a lock renders the fence useless. Many people opt for gates that automatically swing closed and lock unless you actively hold them open. You need to be able to secure the pool with the lock when you&#8217;re not home.
3. The gate and fence have to stay in good working order
Homeowners cannot let the fence or the gate fall into disrepair so that it no longer functions. If a section collapses, it must be repaired and rebuilt. If the gate&#8217;s lock breaks, it needs to get replaced. Homeowners should check the gates and fences periodically to ensure that they&#8217;re still up to code.
Your rights
Has your child gotten injured or even passed away in a drowning accident that another homeowner could have prevented? Be sure you know what legal options you have.The post Swimming pool fence requirements in Ohio first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern medicine is exceptionally good at treating traumatic injuries. Everything from bullet holes to broken bones can now receive much better care than in centuries or even decades past. Because of how much improvement there has been in trauma care, far too many people tend to have a flippant attitude toward fractures.
Fracture is a more technical term for a broken bone. There are many kinds of fractures, and some of them are more serious than others. While children tend to heal quickly, broken bones are a unique kind of injury in small children. They can actually cause significant issues that persist for a long time.
Any parent whose child wound up with a broken bone should monitor the situation closely and take steps to ensure that their child receives the care they need to completely heal.
Compound fractures can require surgery and intensive care
A simple fracture is what most people think of when they imagine a broken bone. It involves a clean break to the bone, which snaps into two pieces. Doctors can then align the broken parts of the bone, place the limb or extremity in a cast and allow the body to heal itself.
Many broken bones are actually far more complicated than a simple fracture. The bone may break in multiple places, making it difficult or impossible to set without surgical intervention. In some cases, the bone can break so severely that parts of it get destroyed.
Medical care such as reinforcement via metal rods implanted in the broken bone may be necessary. Patients who are young when this happens will likely require a number of reparative surgeries over the years as their body continues to grow and develop.
Broken bones in children can also impact the growth plate
The reason that children keep on growing is that they have growth plates in the bones that tell the body it isn&#8217;t yet at its full potential. When a child experiences a compound fracture, or even a simple fracture, the end result could be damage to the growth plate.This can have a long-term impact on how well the child&#8217;s body continues to develop.
Extreme medical intervention may be necessary, especially if the child is an infant or very young when the growth plate winds up damaged. The medical care involved in such treatment is clearly going to be prohibitively expensive for many families.
If your child was injured on someone else&#8217;s property or as a result of a catastrophic accident in a motor vehicle, you may be in an actionable position. Consult with an experienced personal injury attorney who can help you determine if you have the right to seek compensation for your child&#8217;s injuries.The post Broken bones in young children can do more damage than you think first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last fall, as thousands of Ohio State students prepared for their first day of class, one young woman who had planned to start her freshman year instead lay in a hospital bed. The young woman was involved in a serious pedestrian and car accident days before classes were scheduled to start when she was hit by a car while walking.
Today, doctors marvel at the progress and recovery Rachel Stump has made. Upon first arriving at the hospital, doctors were initially unsure as to whether the young woman would even survive. She suffered multiple severe internal injuries and a serious brain injury. After waking from a coma, Stump describes how she&#8217;s battled back both physically and mentally after months of medical care and physical therapy.
She&#8217;s currently enrolled in one class at OSU to prove she&#8217;s mentally capable of completing assignments. She plans to take additional courses this summer and return as a full-time student living near campus next fall.
While it appears as though Stump&#8217;s story has a happy ending, such scenarios aren&#8217;t typical in most accidents in which an individual sustains multiple internal injuries and a traumatic brain injury. Such injuries are life-threatening and often render an individual physically or mentally disabled. In Stump&#8217;s case, doctors are amazed by her progress and focus on making a full recovery.
Ohio residents who have been injured in car accidents or pedestrian accidents often require both emergency and ongoing medical care. Additionally, such injuries typically require an individual to take time off of work and incur large sums of medical debt. For these individuals, a personal injury lawsuit may be an appropriate means to help recoup compensation related to medical expenses, pain and suffering and lost wages.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone knows that car accidents can cause serious injuries. However, most people would assume that the injuries happen upon the initial impact and not afterward. That was not the case for a recent Ohio crash that left a man in critical condition.
On July 16, a van struck a car in Clintonville. The driver of the car, a 25-year-old man, was not harmed in the initial crash. But when he exited his vehicle to inspect it, his car was struck from behind by another motorist. This impact pinned him between his car and the van.
Paramedics arrived at the scene and had to extract the man from between the two vehicles. He then was transported to the hospital for medical treatment.
Serious injuries in motor vehicle accidents can seem to occur based on the flip of a coin. Sometimes individuals walk away without a scratch, while other accidents may be fatal. Unfortunately for those who are injured, healing often isn&#8217;t the only struggle. There will be insurance companies to work with, medical bills to pay, accident reports to gather and much more. The process can quickly become stressful and overwhelming, and it is often helpful for accident victims to seek assistance with the process.
An individual who has been injured because of another driver&#8217;s negligence may be entitled to compensation through filing a personal injury claim. This type of lawsuit will help the injured party cover some if not all of the expenses that arise as a result of an accident.
It is important for Columbus residents who have been injured in a car accident to evaluate their options for recovery. Although compensation may not immediately or completely return an injured victim to his or her pre-accident standard of living, such payments can help victims better navigate the recovery process.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[An 82-year-old Ohio man was seriously injured after a semi truck driver, who had apparently ingested methamphetamine and marijuana, ran a red light and crashed his vehicle into the 82-year-old&#8217;s pickup. The man who was injured in the truck accident was taken to a local hospital but was later transported by helicopter to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. Reportedly, the elderly man was still in the hospital&#8217;s intensive care unit on Wednesday, but he was said to be in stable condition.
The 52-year-old semi driver, also from Ohio, faces a preliminary charge of driving while intoxicated causing serious bodily injury, which is a Class D felony charge that typically carries an 18-month prison sentence upon conviction. The man&#8217;s semi was pulling a grain trailer when it slammed into the pickup truck shortly after noon on Jan. 10. Witnesses of the accident said that the semi truck barreled into the intersection despite having a red-light signal. Police investigators said that there was no indication that the semi driver applied his breaks or tried to avoid a collision before crashing into the pickup.
Reportedly, a blood test administered by police indicated that the 52-year-old semi driver had traces of methamphetamine and marijuana in his blood when the accident occurred. A tube with meth in it was found in the semi driver&#8217;s shirt pocket, and in a nearby field, police located a plastic bag and a pipe which both contained marijuana. Additionally, police found in a nearby church parking lot a plastic container with more meth in it, plus a single Oxycontin pill was located in the glove compartment of the semi. A witness claims he saw the truck driver walking in a field and tossing away items just after the accident.
The semi driver, who is currently being held in a county jail, is likely to be charged with drug crimes. He may also expect to face a personal injury claim for the apparently reckless and negligent behavior that resulted in the 82-year-old&#8217;s serious injuries.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[People injured through the fault of another, such as a personal injury case, often must retain a lawyer and see that a lawsuit is filed on their behalf so that their rights are protected. If you are seriously injured by a negligent driver in a truck crash or car accident, or due to substandard medical care, you may need to take your case to court if the insurance company either denies responsibility, or is not willing to be fair in the settlement process. Once a claim is made, or especially when a case is filed, your health and medical history becomes &#8220;fair game&#8221; for the insurance company or defense lawyers to investigate.
What people often don&#8217;t realize is that the insurance companies and their attorneys have been known to check social media sites to look for postings by people who have made claims for their injuries or filed cases for fair compensation. Injury claims are then compared to statements on sites like Facebook and MySpace, and if there are inconsistencies, they can be used against the injured person. For instance, if a car crash victim who claims an inability to do certain activities, then talks about doing those activities on a networking site, those posts can be exploited by the insurance company fighting the claim.
There was an actual case in which a seriously injured crash victim claimed he couldn&#8217;t engage in vigorous activities such as bike riding like he used to.  He also said he was limited in hobbies such as painting.  Unfortunately, he posted anecdotes about himself biking and painting and then his posts were used to discredit his case and lower its value.
Statements taken out of context can be used against even honest and truthful people and posts to social media sites can create unnecessary skepticism and potentially have a huge impact on a legal case. The personal injury lawyers at  Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC  will advise you through every step of your personal injury or medical malpractice case, including what information not to share on social networking sites.The post Impact of Social Media on Personal Injury/Medical Malpractice Cases first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>
