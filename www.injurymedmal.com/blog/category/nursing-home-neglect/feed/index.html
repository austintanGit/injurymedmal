Nursing homes are intended to provide a place of care and safety for the frail and elderly. Loved ones who place their relatives in a nursing home do not take the decision lightly, and it can be difficult to place all trust in the care providers. Unfortunately, there has been some horrific stories of nursing home neglect, particularly in Ohio.
This blog will offer a brief overview into the rights that nursing home residents have to proper care and standards of living, and how relatives and loved ones can go about defending those rights if they feel that nursing home neglect has taken place.
Types of health care facilities
The law distinguishes between four different types of care facilities. The reason for this distinction is because of the different levels of care offered. From the lowest to highest levels of care, these are &#8220;adult boarding facilities,&#8221; &#8220;residential care facilities,&#8221; &#8220;intermediate care facilities&#8221; and &#8220;skilled nursing facilities.&#8221;
Nursing home resident rights
There are detailed federal guidelines that lay out the rights of nursing home residents, and each nursing home or care unit must develop their own policies and procedures to ensure that these are adhered to. These rights include but are not limited to:

The right to have contact with family members, doctors, attorneys and state representatives
The right to their personal possessions unless they present a danger
The right to choose their own doctor
The right to privacy, from their own rooms to their own private meetings with family
The right to be fully informed on their medical care

If you believe that a loved one&#8217;s rights have been compromised, it is important to try to gather evidence of this mistreatment and speak to a legal professional if necessary.

They say that a nation can be judged by how it treats its weakest citizens &#8212; which include the disabled and the elderly.
Unfortunately, the elderly are a high-risk population when it comes to abuse and neglect. The longer that people live, the less likely they are to remain active in their community. This means that they aren&#8217;t a visible presence.
That makes it harder for people to know when abuse and neglect are happening, especially if they&#8217;re living with supposedly loving family members who are more interested in the senior&#8217;s Social Security benefits or pension than they are in that person&#8217;s health and well-being.
Even social service agencies can have a hard time stopping abuse. First, someone has to alert them that there is a problem &#8212; a big hurdle because family members often are afraid that they&#8217;ll be found out if they tell and face retaliation. Second, these agencies have to find the senior.
Take the case of the 78-year-old man who couldn&#8217;t bathe himself or take his own medication. To keep social services from putting the former pastor in a home (which would have meant an end to any income provided by the elderly man&#8217;s benefits), his grandson hid him from caseworkers at a private nursing home, a hotel and then in an empty apartment. When caseworkers finally found the man, he was sitting alone in a room without a bed, food or supervision.
One of the problems that has faced caseworkers is that many work for different agencies with similar goals, but they weren&#8217;t able to share information with each other easily.
Ohio is taking steps to change that. The creation of interdisciplinary teams, or I-Teams, makes it easier for the various agencies to combine their efforts and manpower when dealing with a difficult case of suspected abuse or neglect.
While social service organizations like the Agency on Aging and the Job and Family Services Department (which overseas the Medicaid program many senior are on) are already working together, I-Teams would like to see help from area hospitals, the coroner&#8217;s office, local prosecutor&#8217;s, probate courts and local banks &#8212; all of whom may know information that could help.
Elder neglect and abuse is a national problem that can happen whether the senior is at home with a relative or in a supposedly safe environment like a nursing home. If you suspect neglect, talk to an attorney today.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nursing home abuse is more common than you might expect. Each year, thousands of residents at long-term care facilities are either injured or lose their lives because they don&#8217;t receive an adequate level of care. Among the many types of neglectful behavior these individuals&#8217; caregivers include not helping residents in moving about, with eating, or with basic hygiene are the most common.
Residents who received inadequate care risk suffering both mental and physical injuries. Family members who are aware of the warning signs their loved ones face are most apt to keep them from suffering unrecoverable outcomes.
State laws require that nursing homes maintain a certain standard of cleanliness and safety. Additionally, under existing federal law, this type of facility must implement certain infection control protocol to contain any chance of a disease&#8217;s spread.
In terms of personal hygiene, nursing home staff is supposed to ensure that all residents are able to get baths, have their hair combed and nails cut, and their teeth brushed. Lack of routine dental care has been shown to be a big problem faced by nursing home residents.
As for malnutrition, it&#8217;s estimated that at least 20 percent of nursing home residents are either dehydrated or inadequately fed at any one point of time. In some cases, this can be caused by a resident&#8217;s inability to swallow.
While well-staffed nursing home facilities will take the time necessary to ensure that residents who lack mobility are able to get the exercise they need, there are many that do not. Residents who do are less likely to fall as they&#8217;re able to build up the strength in their muscles, increase their balance, or improve their circulation. They also are less apt to get infections like bedsores caused by being confined to their beds.
Data published by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) suggests that, each year, more than 1,800 elderly nursing home residents have preventable falls. Even more patients experience unexplained broken bones, head injuries, or bruises while living in these types of facilities. Others experience mood shifts whereby they are no longer willing to eat, take their prescribed medications, or to clean themselves.
If your loved one is showing any combination of these warning signs, then you should consult a Columbus, Ohio nursing home neglect attorney right away.

Nursing home neglect and abuse is a serious problem in many of the nation&#8217;s nursing homes and assisted living centers. Our seniors should never have to deal with neglect and abuse on any level. If it does occur, though, who can help?
One person who can help is an ombudsman. This is a Swedish term meaning &#8220;citizen representative.&#8221; Long-term Care Ombudsman programs provide assistance and advocacy to those in long-term care facilities. The main duty of an ombudsman is to ensure the rights of residents are protected. They not only can help with neglect and abuse issues by investigating and getting help for the victim, but they can help with other concerns as well, such as:
&#8212; Resolving complaints
&#8212; Locating a facility
&#8212; Getting quality care
&#8212; Provides information to families on a resident&#8217;s rights
&#8212; Promotes community involvement
&#8212; Promotes the development of resident councils, family councils and citizen organizations
An ombudsman can address concerns on:
&#8212; Physical, verbal or mental abuse
&#8212; Deprivation of services necessary to a resident&#8217;s physical and/or mental health
&#8212; Unreasonable confinement
&#8212; Violations of residents&#8217; dignity or rights
&#8212; Poor quality of care, including slow responses to requests for assistance or inadequate personal care&#8217;
&#8212; Inappropriate use of physical or chemical restraints
&#8212; Improper discharge or transfer of resident
If your loved one is neglected or abused by a member of the staff, another resident or anyone else, the ombudsman for the facility can be a terrific resource for help. In addition, you may need to notify the police. An attorney can help you determine if a claim for compensation is also something you can pursue.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whether it be neglecting a nursing home resident&#8217;s basis hygiene, not rendering necessary assistance with eating, or forcing them to remain bedridden because no accommodations are made for their mobility; these are just some of the many examples of nursing home abuse. Unfortunately, there are many others though as well.
Failure to offer a resident the necessary level of care he or she needs is considered neglect. Not receiving an adequate level of care exposes residents to the potential for suffering both profound and potentially permanent not only bodily, but psychological damage as well.
When it comes to personal hygiene, nursing home staff is expected to provide residents with assistance in performing basic everyday activities. These include routine tasks like getting dressed, bathing and brushing their teeth.
They are expected to render assistance to residents with activities they are not capable of handling themselves, such as cleaning as well. Nursing home staff is also responsible for ensuring residents have both clean clothing and bedding as well as for keeping their living, bathroom and kitchen areas clean.
Nationwide, more than 20 percent of nursing home residents have been found to have been malnourished, sometimes because of untreated depression or swallowing issues as well as for reasons of neglect. Issues involving malnutrition or dehydration are among the many examples of neglect found in nursing homes.
The goal of assisted living facilities should be to keep residents as active as possible to not only help with circulation, but muscle tone and strength to help with balance and prevent falls. Persistent immobility can lead not only to long term physical limitations, but potential exposure to deadly disease as well.
Unexplained injuries or mood changes should also be met with alarm. Although seniors, on average, fall 2.6 times per year, falls at nursing homes may be representative of a resident attempting to do something on their own because of lack of help. Psychological issues may be telling signs of abuse as well.
If you suspect nursing home abuse of someone you know, then you should speak with an Ohio personal injury attorney. In learning more about your loved one&#8217;s case, he or she can explain your rights as it relates to seeking legal remedy in your particular case.

Dehydration is one of the biggest problems that the elderly face in assisted living centers. On its own, it does not necessarily mean that a resident is being abused or neglected, but it can be a warning sign that family members need to watch out for. It could mean that the staff is not giving the person adequate food and water and is therefore neglecting to meet their needs properly.
For elderly individuals with disabilities, it can be hard for family members to know if they&#8217;re dehydrated since they may not know themselves or they may not say anything. Signs that can be observed that indicate serious dehydration include the following:
&#8212; Weight loss. Experts warn to watch out for quick weight loss, such as dropping two pounds in 24 hours.
&#8212; Headaches and dizziness. If a person has trouble walking, this could also be a related indicator.
&#8212; An increased heart rate and/or dropping blood pressure levels.
&#8212; Eyes that appear too sunken into the head or an excessively dry mouth.
Of course, tracking the loss of bodily fluids may also help. However, it&#8217;s harder to do if you&#8217;re not around the person 24/7. Dehydration may be an issue if the person has a low output of urine, can&#8217;t cry, or does not sweat. Constipation has also been linked to dehydration.
Do you think that a loved on is dehydrated specifically because he or she is being neglected by the staff? This can be a very dire situation with severe consequences. You need to know what legal options you have in Ohio.

The National Center for Elder Abuse reports that two groups of people are abused in nursing homes more than others. These are older residents and female residents. In addition, the NCEA also reported that during a three-year period, a third of U.S. nursing homes received citations for violating federal standards. Violations where residents were in danger of serious injury or death occurred in one in 10 nursing homes.
So, who can report nursing home abuse? A complaint about nursing home abuse can be filed by anyone. However, in Ohio, there are several professionals who must report nursing home abuse according to law. These include:
&#8212; Nurses
&#8212; Doctors
&#8212; Physical therapists
&#8212; Social workers
&#8212; Emergency response personnel
&#8212; Lawyers
&#8212; Law enforcement
Some of the more common forms of nursing home abuse include:
&#8212; Physical abuse, such as bed sores, restraint marks, broken bones and bruises.
&#8212; Neglect, including malnourishment, dehydration, poor hygiene and soiled bedding.
&#8212; Sexual assault, including bruises or bleeding in the genital area and bloodied or torn underwear.
&#8212; Verbal abuse, including visible anger or depression, fear of some people and mumbling.
&#8212; Behavioral or emotional changes, including withdrawal, fear, crying, social isolation or agitation.
&#8212; False imprisonment, including leaving a resident without their crutches, canes or wheelchairs, or by threatening the resident.
&#8212; Financial abuse, including modifying a will or trust due to pressure from another person or the theft of bank account information.
When you report suspected nursing home abuse and neglect, you are demanding that whoever perpetrated the abuse must be held accountable. If you do not receive what you consider is appropriate action on the complaint, then you should call Adult Protective Services in the Ohio county where the nursing home is located. You may also call the state Department of Health or the Department of Aging Long-Term Care Ombudsman. You can also notify the local police department.
An attorney can help you file a complaint about nursing home neglect or abuse. He or she can also provide information on how to seek compensation on your loved one&#8217;s behalf for the injuries he or she suffered.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[It&#8217;s been said that very few medical settings are as challenging as the nursing home. Almost all patients have multiple medical issues, for example, making it chaotic and complex. On top of that, 70 percent of those in nursing homes are dealing with some level of cognitive impairment.
As such, mistakes do happen. Often, these mistakes involve drugs and medications. How common is this?
According to one study, there are around 10 adverse drug events for every 100 resident months. So, if a nursing home had exactly 100 residents, this would mean 10 mistakes per month. If it had 300 residents, though, there would be 30 such mistakes in a month. It&#8217;s easier to calculate the rates based on resident months because different facilities have different numbers of patients and patients may cycle through unpredictably.
Some of these events were not considered preventable, but 40 percent were. The study also found that these preventable errors happened during monitoring and ordering most often. Furthermore, all manner of drugs were involved, including antipsychotic drugs, diuretics, anticoagulants, and antiepileptics. These four categories were deemed to be a &#8220;special risk&#8221; when compared to other types of medications.
One of the big reasons cited for these mistakes was communication issues. Medical decisions may not always be made in person, but on the phone, so there is a chance for miscommunication during this step that leads to the wrong medication being given out, the wrong drug being prescribed, the wrong dosage being administered, and the like.
When you put your loved one in a nursing home, you expect him or her to get a high level of care. If mistakes undermine this care and lead to serious consequences, be sure you know what rights you and your family may have to seek compensation.

Nursing home abuse and neglect are horrible actions that put people who count on others to care for them in danger. The dangers are horrible and can lead to elderly patients being harmed or even killed. In our previous blog post, we discussed the horror of psychological abuse and how this abuse is far too common in nursing homes.
We know that the thought of a loved one being harmed in the nursing home is difficult to think about. For many families, that is a reality of life. People who have a loved one in a nursing home should be on the lookout for signs that things aren&#8217;t going well at the nursing home.
If you notice any signs of nursing home abuse or neglect, you can take action. Filing reports is one option that you have. If your loved one suffered harm because of the abuse or neglect, seeking compensation is another possible course of action. We can help you to explore each option.
Some signs that you should be watchful for include frequent falls, unexplained or poorly explained bruising, wandering away from the nursing home, seeming withdrawn, suffering from bouts of dehydration or malnutrition and having bed sores. All of these are signs that looking into what is going on at this nursing home is necessary.
As much as it might pain you to learn about the abuse or neglect, it is the first step in being able to put a stop to it. Don&#8217;t let your loved one suffer at the hands of those who should be caring for him or her. Take action right away.The post Signs of nursing home abuse shows a need to take action first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>
