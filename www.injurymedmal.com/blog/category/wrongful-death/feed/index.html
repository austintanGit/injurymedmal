																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every year, more than 10,000 individuals are killed in drunk driving accidents. That equates to 28 drunk driving-related deaths every day, which is one death every 52 minutes. The most recent statistics that are available show that Ohio had more than 1,000 drunk driving deaths in a calendar year, which means that there are thousands of families in our state each year who are heartbroken to hear that their loved one was taken from them too soon. Sadly, these numbers have remained relatively consistent over the years despite increased efforts by law enforcement and public awareness initiatives.
While many of the individuals who are responsible for causing these deaths are held criminally liable for their actions, the truth of the matter is that a criminal prosecution does nothing to help families coping with the financial realities that their loss has caused. For these families, merely getting by on a day-to-day basis can be difficult, especially if their loved one was the primary wage earner in the family. While these lost wages can certainly take a toll, so, too, can medical and funeral expenses, not to mention the emotional pain and suffering that befalls these families.
So, what can these families do to find their own sense of accountability and recover the compensation that they’re owed? One option is to pursue a wrongful death lawsuit. Although it might seem easy to pursue one of these cases in the aftermath of a drunk driving accident, they can actually be rather complicated. That’s why if you’ve lost a loved one to one of these tragic wrecks, then you may want to consider taking the following steps to help build your case.

Gather law enforcement observations: In a lot of drunk driving cases, you can turn to law enforcement to help you prove that the other driver was intoxicated at the time of the accident. This is because police officers may have observations, such as smelling alcohol on the driver’s breath shortly after the accident or seeing the driver throw alcohol containers out of the window prior to the accident. Law enforcement may even have seen the drunk driver try to switch seats with a passenger following an accident. As you’re gathering these observations, be sure to obtain any photographs that law enforcement took during the course of their investigation.
Listen to emergency phone call records: A 9-1-1 call may help establish how the driver was operating his or her vehicle at the time of the accident, as well as help you identify witnesses who were concerned about the driver’s actions both before and after the accident.
Collect criminal records: By digging into a driver’s criminal history, you may find a history of drunk driving that helps support your claim. If that driver does have a history of drunk driving, then there’s a decent chance that he or she was driving on a suspended or revoked license, which makes it even easier to show that he or she was driving negligently.
Gather evidence of damages suffered: This might sound simple enough considering that you can just submit any bills you received from your loved one’s medical providers and the funeral services provider, but there’s a lot more to your wrongful death claim than that. You’ll also want to think about how to portray the ways in which your lost loved one supported your family, including nurturing and guiding his or her children. You can also consider how to illustrate the pain and suffering that your loved one must have been subjected to prior to passing away.

Be diligent to build the strong wrongful death claim that you need
If you’ve lost a loved one to a drunk driving accident, then you’re going through what could be the toughest part of your life. Your emotional pain and suffering can be exacerbated by the financial turmoil that has been thrust upon you, which can leave you stressed about your uncertain future. But you shouldn’t despair. Instead, you should seek out the guidance and support that you need to build a thorough and compelling wrongful death claim. Only then can you rest assured that you’ve positioned yourself as best as possible for success and closing this painful chapter of your life.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[The death of a beloved spouse, parent or child is always devastating. Death is a part of life, but when your family member died because of somebody else&#8217;s negligence, your grief may be compounded. Had the person or business acted responsibly, your loved one would still be alive today.
This is the root of wrongful death litigation. Ohio&#8217;s personal injury laws recognize that when a victim of negligence dies, they cannot go to court to recover damages. Someone else must step in on their behalf. In Ohio, this person is the personal representative of the deceased&#8217;s estate, also known as the executor. This might be the deceased&#8217;s spouse or one of their children, but it can be virtually anybody the deceased chose in their estate plan.
A wrongful death can happen the in same ways that any other personal injury incident can, such as:

A car accident caused by a driver who was drunk, distracted, drowsy, violating traffic laws or otherwise acting negligently
Medical malpractice, such as negligent misdiagnosis, surgical errors, or abuse or neglect in a nursing home
A fatal fall due to hazardous conditions at a store, office building, public park or other property that the property owner failed to repair or warn visitors about
Defective products, including medications and motor vehicles

The only difference is that the victim does not survive their injuries.
Possible damages in wrongful death litigation
Besides the deceased, the executor acts for the exclusive benefit of the deceased&#8217;s surviving spouse, children and/or parents, if any. Wrongful death affects these parties differently. Damages that the executor can seek on behalf of the deceased&#8217;s estate include:

Medical costs
Pain and suffering
Punitive damages

In addition, surviving family members may be directly eligible for these damages:

Loss of financial support
Loss of companionship/consortium with a spouse
Loss of guidance of a parent
Loss of prospective inheritance based on the deceased&#8217;s lost future earning power
Mental anguish
Funeral costs

The statute of limitations imposes a time limit on taking legal action following a person&#8217;s death. The general rule in Ohio is that the personal representative must file suit within two years of the deceased&#8217;s death. The principle behind statutes of limitation is that as time passes, evidence can disappear, and witnesses&#8217; memories can fade. If the statute of limitation has expired before you file a lawsuit, the court will dismiss your lawsuit regardless of the merits. No matter how strong your case is, it will be too late to present it.
Time is of the essence
Two years is not a long time when it comes to a wrongful death claim. Complex cases involving matters like medical malpractice take time to prepare. This is something to keep in mind when you believe your loved one died due to someone else&#8217;s negligence and are considering making a wrongful death claim.The post The basics of wrongful death law in Ohio first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Typically, in a personal injury case the more serious the injuries suffered, the greater the compensation. At the most extreme end of the spectrum is wrongful death.
In a wrongful death case, the victim died as a result of another person’s negligence. Common examples of wrongful death incidents include fatal drunk driving accidents, trucking accidents and medical malpractice.
What these tragedies have in common is that the deceased would still be alive if not for the actions of someone else. In Ohio, the person or business that caused the victim&#8217;s death is liable for the harm they caused the victim, as well as the harm suffered by the victim&#8217;s family.
What families can seek in wrongful death litigation
Since the victim cannot bring a wrongful death lawsuit themselves, their estate&#8217;s executor must do it, along with surviving family members, such as the spouse, children and parents. Damages the estate can claim include the pain and suffering the deceased endured due to the defendant&#8217;s negligence before passing away.
Another basis for compensation in a wrongful death claim is known as pecuniary damages. This refers to the family&#8217;s loss of the deceased&#8217;s support and services, as well as the potential future inheritance they likely lost had the victim lived longer. Families can also recover for the deceased&#8217;s funeral and medical expenses.
Finally, family members can recover for non-economic damages related to the death.  These damages include mental anguish, loss of companionship and other similar harm.  This category of damages can be significant.
An example
Depending on the victim&#8217;s age, health, earning power, life expectancy and other factors, pecuniary damages can be quite high.
Imagine a 27-year-old woman who dies because of a car accident or a preventable surgical error. She was a married mother of two, she was college-educated and beginning a promising career. In a case like this, a jury might find that her family suffered millions of dollars in damages due to her death. In addition, non-economic damages for mental anguish of surviving family members can be significant regardless of the deceased family member’s education or earnings.
No legal action can change the past, or bring back a loved one. Nevertheless, wrongful death litigation can help protect you from disastrous financial problems and provide compensation for the significant emotional harm suffered by family members.The post What types of damages can be sought in wrongful death cases? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[The widow of an Ohio beer-dispensing system inventor who was found dead inside a baseball stadium beer cooler has filed a wrongful death lawsuit seeking compensation for damages. The death happened in Georgia in June 2018.
 The victim, a 48-year-old father of four, patented a beer-pouring system called &#8220;Draftwell&#8221;, which was designed to reduce the amount of time it takes to pour a pint of beer from an average of 14 seconds to just five seconds. He marketed the invention to sports stadiums and installed it in two Major League Baseball parks. He was in the process of installing the system in a third venue, the Atlanta Braves&#8217; SunTrust Park, when he decided to work an overnight shift. He was found dead in a concession stand beer cooler the next day. According to police investigators, he died after being exposed to carbon dioxide that was leaking from the draft beer system in the park. 
In her lawsuit, the victim&#8217;s widow alleges that the construction team tasked with installing the new beer system knew that there were problems with the door release mechanisms in multiple coolers throughout the stadium. She also claims that the Atlanta Braves were aware of the faulty doors and the carbon dioxide leaks. She is suing the builders and the Braves for the loss of her husband&#8217;s income, his pain and suffering before death, the mental anguish that she and her family suffered following his death, medical expenses, funeral costs and other damages as permitted by statute.
Families who lose loved ones due to the negligent actions of others may need the help of Columbus, Ohio, wrongful death attorneys. The attorneys could collect evidence proving the negligent party is legally responsible for the victim&#8217;s death and file a wrongful death lawsuit on the family&#8217;s behalf.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people feel surprised when they learn that their loved one had an opioid addiction. Most people who struggle with an addiction take great pains to hide it from the people whom they love the most. That can leave you with more questions than answers after the unexpected and tragic loss of someone you love due to an opioid overdose.
In that scenario, you may find yourself wanting to take legal action against the people involved in supplying your loved one with deadly drugs. You may find yourself wondering whether the best strategy involves filing a medical malpractice lawsuit against a doctor or perhaps seeking compensation for a wrongful death.
The truth is that the circumstances of the Ohio accidental overdose and how your loved one obtained the medication will play a role in what legal action you can take.
Was the medicine prescribed directly to your loved one by a doctor?
The first and most important question you need to answer is whether your loved one had opioid medication prescribed to them by a doctor or whether they were buying it illegally from a third party, such as a drug dealer.
If a doctor was the one who provided the prescription, you should then look at the circumstances under which the prescription was provided. Did your loved one have a history of seeking medication? Was the prescription the result of an accident or surgery? How many pills did the doctor distribute at once?
That last question, as well as how many refills a doctor authorizes and how often they follow up with the patient, can play a major role in whether there was medical malpractice or negligence involved in an overdose.
Illegal pill sales may lead to a wrongful death case
When people have too many pills that they don&#8217;t need, they might sell them to other people. In fact, some people go so far as to intentionally steal medication from others in order to sell it illegally to third parties. If you can find who sold the medication to your loved one, you may be able to pursue a wrongful death lawsuit against them.
Under Ohio law, a wrongful death involves negligence or a wrongful act. The illegal sale of narcotic pain medication certainly qualifies as a wrongful act. In other words, you likely have grounds for a civil suit even if law enforcement never prosecuted the person who supplied your loved one.
It can be hard to decide what your next step should be after the sudden and tragic overdose death of a loved one. You should explore all of your options by sitting down with an experienced Ohio personal injury attorney. They can guide you toward holding the right people accountable for the tragedy your family has experienced.The post Is an opioid overdose case medical malpractice or wrongful death? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>
