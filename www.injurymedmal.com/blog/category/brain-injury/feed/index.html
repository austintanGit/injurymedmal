																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious injury that comes about if an unexpected physical shock does damage to the person’s brain. A TBI can cause serious, long-lasting damage to a person’s brain (which can result in disability) or it can cause death. TBI is an umbrella term and many other, more specific injuries fall under that category. Because the brain is such a complex organ, the destruction can be confined to one area of the brain or it can be more widespread. Also, the damage to the brain can be mild (a mild concussion) or it can result in severe injury, coma, or death.
Different kinds of TBIs
There are a few different types of brain injuries that are seen in individuals.

Penetrating brain injury: This is an injury in which the skull is open. This occurs if some sort of object has actually entered the skull and has created an opening.
Closed brain injury: This type of injury occurs when something hits the head but does not break the skull. It commonly occurs if the head has been jolted backward and forward and moves the brain and it then becomes bruised, potentially tears the brain tissue, and can disrupt the blood vessels in the brain. This type of brain injury is often caused by the person falling, a motor-vehicle accident, and from sports.
Primary and secondary brain injury: A primary injury is a serious injury to the brain that is a complete injury upon impact. A typical example of a primary brain injury is the result of a car accident, a fall, or a wound from a gunshot. A secondary brain injury is when the results of the injury develop over time and the worst outcome is not seen initially. With a secondary injury, the cells, chemistry, tissues, and or blood vessels are altered, which can lead to significant damage to the brain.
Diffuse axonal injury: This is a tearing of the brain’s nerve fibers, which can occur to the brain upon impact if the brain shifts and turns in the skull. This type of injury commonly causes a coma and injuries to various parts of the brain to occur. The developments that occur in the brain as a result of an accident are often too small to see with the naked eye and may possibly not be seen on a scan.

The causes of a head injury, bruising and brain damage
There are many different possible causes of a head injury in both adults and children. Motor vehicle accidents often cause head injuries. Head injuries may also occur when people fall or they are physically abused in any number of ways.
If someone receives a direct hit to their head, the brain may be physically damaged. One possible bruise to the brain will appear directly where the impact occurred. The brain will move backward because of the impact of the hit and it will run into the skull. This can also cause the brain’s lining, blood vessels, and tissues to cause bruising, bleeding and swelling. If a person does have brain damage as a result of some impact, their symptoms may be mild or they may be more severe. There are some people who suffer permanent damage as the result of a severe injury, which will affect their life in different ways.
Valuable legal advice from a Columbus lawyer
If you have suffered a TBI as a result of another person’s negligence, you may wish to consult with a Columbus, Ohio, lawyer, who can give you the benefit of their knowledge and expertise. The lawyer can ensure that your rights are protected and that you hopefully can receive the compensation that you need and to which you are entitled.The post Exactly what is traumatic brain injury and how long does it last? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[You suffer a traumatic brain injury in an accident. Someone pulls out in front of you as you drive through Columbus. You do everything in your power to avoid the crash, but you can&#8217;t. You lose consciousness and wake up in the hospital.
The doctors tell you that you have a TBI and the full impact on your physical, mental and emotional health has yet to be seen. They don&#8217;t know exactly what changes you&#8217;ll experience. They warn you that every TBI is different.
That&#8217;s true, but there is one thing that is fairly consistent: Experts note that the TBI will likely &#8220;impact every relationship&#8221; that you have.
Work relationships
For instance, one of the most common thoughts that people have after a TBI is that their employer wants to fire them. This may or may not be true, but they worry about it all of the time. They assume that their boss is just looking for an excuse. This can change relationships with co-workers, supervisors and everyone else in the office.
Relationships with friends
Another common concern is that people just cannot relate to you after you suffer from a TBI. You feel like they don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re going through. It&#8217;s harder to talk to them. They may treat you differently. You feel cut off from these people who used to be such a big part of your life.
Family relationships
Naturally, the biggest impact may be to relationships with your family members. After all, a TBI can change the way that you feel and act. You could become very irritable and angry, whereas you used to be happy and relaxed. This is something that impacts your family members every single day. They may think that you have:

New fears
New limitations
New challenges
New personality traits

The tough part is that this isn&#8217;t a perception issue on their part. You may honestly act like a different person. You may have limitations and challenges to overcome. That&#8217;s just your new reality.
However, in some cases, it makes people say that they feel like their spouse is a stranger. It takes a lot of work for couples to get through something like this, and not all of them can do it. If they have children, things get even more complicated, because those are not relationships that can end.
Moving forward
Overall, you need to be aware of the different ways that a TBI can change your lifeand some of the challenges you may face. You also need to know if you have a right in Ohio to compensation for your medical bills, pain and suffering, lost wages, and other costs.The post The impact of a TBI on your relationships first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

The match between famed boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and the United Fighting Championship (UFC) champion Conor McGregor on Saturday, August 26th was highly anticipated. Although McGregor had told his fans he intended to win his &#8216;money match,&#8217; it ended up with his 10th round knockout of the technical variety instead.
Soon after the match was prematurely terminated, media outlets began questioning the veteran referee that had been hired to work the match. They wondered if he&#8217;d exercised sound judgement in ending the match when he did.
He noted that, when he decided to end the match, it was clear that the UFC fighter already looked physically battered. He also said that he appeared to be unstable on his feet.
Initially, the referee thought that McGregor wasn&#8217;t accustomed to spending 30 minutes as he just had in the ring getting bruised and battered. He thought that McGregor was simply very fatigued. Within moments though, a ringside physician who evaluated the famed fighter determined he was suffering traumatic brain injury symptoms instead.
That ringside physician has since praised the referee for knowing when to pull the plug on the match. Seemingly, under further evaluation, he determined that the UFC fighter was suffering from ataxia, a condition which leaves afflicted individuals with poor balance or dizziness. This is one of the telltale signs of a concussion.
The doctor said that had the referee not stopped the match when he did, he would have been grossly negligent.
If you&#8217;ve suffered a brain injury as the result of someone else&#8217;s negligence, then you may benefit from discussing your case with a Columbus, Ohio personal injury attorney. In doing so, he or she can advise you of potential legal remedies available to you to cover medical expenses associated with your injury.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[After a car accident, most people involved can be in a state of shock or experience an adrenaline rush that can make it hard to think. The mental trauma can make it difficult to truly assess the severity of your injuries. It can actually take several days before some symptoms make themselves known. This is one of the reasons why, if you have been in a car accident, it is important to see your doctor as soon as possible for an assessment.
Since some injury symptoms develop over time, you should become familiar with what to watch for in the days following a car accident. Read below for delayed injuries it may take several days for you to become aware of after a motor vehicle collision.
Brain injuries
While some brain injuries are easy to see, especially if there is visible trauma to the head, others are not. It is not unusual to suffer from headaches several days after a car accident, however, it could be a sign of serious damage. For example, headaches could be a sign of a blood clot, bruising, or other damage to the brain, head or neck.
Whiplash symptoms
If can often take days before you feel the full effects of whiplash. This type of injury usually occurs due to rear-end collisions, even ones that happen at a low rate of speed. If you are experiencing neck or should pain, or stiffness in that region, see your doctor as soon as possible for x-rays and treatment.
Back injuries
Back pain is another common symptom you might experience after a car accident. Even a small amount of force can damage to the muscles, ligaments and nerves in the back. Larger amounts of force can result in injuries to the vertebrae. Rear-end and side collisions are the most common culprits behind these kinds of injuries.
Internal bleeding
If you experience abdominal pain or swelling, you might be suffering from internal bleeding. In addition, if you have areas with deep purple bruising or you feel faint or dizzy, these could also be signs of internal injuries. It can sometimes take hours or days to see signs of internal injuries. Since these kinds of injuries can be fatal, it is important that you seek medical attention immediately if you see symptoms.
Loss of feeling
Damage to the spinal cord or neck can cause you to experience numbness in your arms or hands. Numbness can be a sign of whiplash or another injury that is affecting the nerves.
If you have been in a car accident, it may take days for even minor injuries to develop. See a medical professional as soon as possible so that you can get the treatment you need and start down the road to recovery. You may also be able to file a claim for your injuries and get the compensation you deserve after a wreck with a negligent driver.The post It may take days to realize you were hurt after a car accident first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

A traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs when there is a blow, bump or jolt to the head that causes a disruption in the brain&#8217;s normal functions. Not every blow will result in a TBI. The most common type of TBI is a concussion, although the injury can be much more severe.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common cause of TBIs was falls. Forty-seven percent of visits to the emergency room (ER), hospital admissions and deaths related to TBIs are due to falls. The oldest and youngest age groups are the most affected by falls.
Fifty-four percent of children 0 to 14 years old who were seen in the ER, hospitalized or died due to TBIs suffered the injury in a fall. For adults 65 and older, it is 79 percent.
Being struck against or by an object is the second-most common cause of TBIs. Children who were under 15 years old accounted for 22 percent of ER visits, hospital admissions or deaths related to TBIs.
Motor vehicle crashes came in as the third leading cause of deaths, hospitalizations or ER visits due to TBIs for all age groups. In 2013, the second leading cause of deaths related to TBIs was intentional self-harm.
These statistics show how common TBIs can be and why fall prevention is so important. If you have suffered a TBI due to someone else&#8217;s negligence, carelessness or recklessness, you may be able to seek compensation from the at-fault party. Damages may include medical expenses, lost wages, emotional trauma and more.

If you have children, getting them to wear bike helmets may be a constant struggle. They don&#8217;t want to wear them, and you have to fight about it every time they go for a ride.
Some parents give up. However, a new study says that helmets are incredibly helpful, massively reducing the odds of serious head injuries.
Specifically, the study claims that the chances of a head injury drop by 51 percent when wearing a helmet. This includes minor injuries. The impact is even more dramatic when looking at serious head injuries, as the odds fall by a full 69 percent. Facial injuries odds also drop, though not by as much since bike helmets typically don&#8217;t have face shields. They fell by just 33 percent &#8212; which is still significant.
Though it may be hard to think about, what you&#8217;re most worried about as a parent is a fatal injury. You&#8217;ll be glad to know that the odds of a deadly head injury fall by 65 percent when wearing a helmet.
Neck injuries did remain unchanged. However, researchers said these weren&#8217;t really connected to helmet use and they were also considered rare.
As you can see, getting your kids to wear their bike helmets is huge, whether you&#8217;re worried about them crashing on their own or being struck by motor vehicles. That helmet could save a child&#8217;s life and prevent life-changing brain injuries.
If your child is hurt, though, you may find yourself facing high medical bills. Be sure you know all of the legal options you have to seek compensation.

The treatment of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) depends on the severity of the injury. For TBIs that are quite severe acute treatment may be needed. The purpose of this type of treatment is to minimize life support and secondary injury.
When the brain suffers such a serious injury, the intracranial pressure can quickly rise. A device can be surgically inserted into the cavity of the brain that can monitor the pressure and help control it.
The patient could be given medications that put him or her into a coma. This helps prevent the patient from further injuring him- or herself and to keep him or her from becoming too agitated. Since seizures can also be a strong possibility, medications that prevent seizures may also be prescribed.
When the patient begins to show signs of recovering some function, more medications can be ordered for controlling aggressive behavior as well as other behavioral issues. In addition, medication may be able to help attention problems, too.
Because the symptoms that a patient with a TBI may experience can vary significantly, treatments are often not identical. Some of the symptoms for a severe TBI include:
&#8212; Speaking very fast or slow
&#8212; Not understanding what is said
&#8212; Loss or partial loss of vision
&#8212; Photophobia or an intolerance of light
&#8212; Increased sensitivity to sound, tinnitus or loss of hearing
&#8212; Seizures
&#8212; Paralysis
&#8212; Loss of bladder and bowel control
&#8212; Aggression, depression, lack of awareness and disinhibition
Have your or a loved one suffered a TBI? If so, you may be able to recover compensation for your damages through a personal injury lawsuit. An attorney can provide more information on this process and how to include future medical expenses in your pursuit of damages.

The goal of the program is to develop &#8220;next-generation technologies that improve memory function in people who suffer from memory loss.&#8221; Their recent findings were published in Current Biology.
The neuroscientists report that electrical stimulation can improve a person&#8217;s memory function when it is delivered when memory failure is predicted. When the electrical stimulation is delivered when a person&#8217;s memory is functioning properly, the stimulation is disruptive.
The lead author said, &#8220;By applying machine-learning methods to electrical signals measured at widespread locations throughout the human brain, we are able to identify neural activity that indicates when a given patient will have lapses of memory encoding.&#8221;
The study involved patients who suffer from epilepsy. They were asked to remember a list of common words while undergoing safe stimulation of the brain. They determined that when the stimulation occurs when the person&#8217;s memory is working properly, memory worsens. When the stimulation arrives when the memory is not functioning properly, memory improves.
The neuroscientists believe that this process could help improve the lives of people who have suffered traumatic brain injuries or who suffer from neurological disease like Alzheimer&#8217;s. However, there is more work needed to be able to develop an &#8220;actual therapeutic platform.&#8221;
Suffering from a traumatic brain injury can have drastic effects on a person&#8217;s life. For those who were injured due to another person&#8217;s negligence, an attorney can help them seek compensation to cover medical expenses, lost wages and more.

Brain injuries can affect victims for the rest of their lives. We recently discussed the symptoms of internal brain injuries. Be sure you keep those in mind if you are involved in any type of accident that caused you to hit your head or that rattled your head.
When it comes to brain injuries, there are many different types of injuries that can occur. One particularly gruesome brain injury is a penetrating brain injury. This means that something went into the skull or that a piece of the skull went into the brain.
A big concern with penetrating brain injuries is the risk of infection. This possibility comes from bacteria and germs on the item that penetrates the brain. In many cases, these injuries require surgery.
As you can imagine, all brain injuries can negatively impact the victim and the people who help to care for the victim. Even children can be impacted by a parent&#8217;s brain injury. The financial impact and the changes the brain injury causes are two of the primary ways that a brain injury can impact everyone in the house.
At our law firm, we take all of these points into consideration when we take on a case involving a brain injury. These cases are often complex, so be sure that you don&#8217;t wait too long to get your case started.
We must comply with Ohio time limits on filing claims for brain injuries. The longer you wait to get things started, the less time you will have to build up your claim against those responsible for the injury.The post Brain injuries can affect everyone in the household first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

It can be hard for parents to spot an internal head injury. You know your child had an accident, but there&#8217;s not all that much exterior damage. Your child is too young to identify symptoms or tell you about them. What should you look for?
The brain does have some cushioning thanks to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds it. However, this is not always enough to stop internal injuries, even when exterior damage is limited. For instance, perhaps your child was wearing a bike helmet and so there are no lacerations, but the brain still moved violently within the skull at the moment of impact. Major symptoms of an internal injury include:
&#8212; Seizures, even those that occur relatively long after the incident.
&#8212; Losing consciousness, even for just 30 seconds or so.
&#8212; Issues with vision or speech. The child may seem disoriented or confused.
&#8212; Issues with abnormal breathing.
&#8212; Blood or other fluid coming out of the mouth, ear or nose.
&#8212; Pupils that do not dilate properly. For example, one could be larger than the other.
&#8212; Stiffness and neck pain. If the child can&#8217;t tell you about the pain, it may still be obvious when he or she moves.
&#8212; General weakness. In the worst cases, this could even result in paralysis, which could be temporary or permanent, depending on the injury.
If your child has suffered a brain injury due to someone else&#8217;s negligence, you may be able to seek compensation. After all, medical care can be expensive and some brain injuries can impact a child for life.
