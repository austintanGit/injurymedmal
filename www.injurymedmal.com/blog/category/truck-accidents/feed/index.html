																<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the weather heats up, roads in Ohio and throughout the Midwest will soon become crowded with heavy machines. From construction vehicles moving to and from large projects to 18-wheelers delivering products and materials across the country, roads connecting communities, cities and states will be busy. Unfortunately, numerous factors can contribute to an unsafe driving environment.
Even though they are professional drivers, truckers are not immune to making mistakes while behind the wheel. Unfortunately, they are prone to fatigue due to long hours, a tight schedule and the monotony of hundreds of miles of road each day. When fatigue or drowsiness overcomes a truck driver, motorists in smaller passenger vehicles are at risk for catastrophic injuries.
Numerous factors can cause truck driver fatigue, including:

Schedule pressure: Truck drivers are under immense pressure to make deliveries quickly and safely. While numerous restrictions are in place to guarantee a driver takes the mandated rest breaks, some truckers will still push themselves to the limits of exhaustion to stay productive. Unfortunately, this results in unsafe driving habits and dangerous roadways.
Impaired driving: Whether it is a long haul across thousands of miles or the final delivery of a double shift, drivers often rely on illegal substances to either improve their mood or help them pass the time. Unfortunately, numerous substances can impair cognitive ability, dull perceptions and slow reaction times.
Powerful medication: It is not uncommon for individuals to rely on prescription or over-the-counter medication to alleviate symptoms such as those that accompany a cold, stomach flu or seasonal allergies. Unfortunately, these medications can make a trucker drowsy, dizzy and unsafe.

Whether it is a city street, county road or highway, drivers must always be on the lookout for dangerous drivers. While many people stereotype a dangerous driver as someone who is speeding or driving recklessly, numerous factors lead to danger. If the truck driver is distracted, impaired or fatigued, can a devastating collision be far behind?The post Are you sharing the road with drowsy truckers? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Staying safe while on the road is a constant challenge for drivers. Driving near large trucks, however, seems to be a more significant challenge than many people expect. In fact, one out of every eight deaths in car accidents involves a large truck. While you can usually always see these chipping vehicles on the road, they may not always see you. How can you be sure that you are in a safe space around them?
Know the blind spots
A bigger vehicle means that everything that comes with it is bigger, including the blind spots. For semi-trucks, their blind spots can obscure multiple vehicles at the same time. There are four primary zones that you should always avoid to ensure the truck driver can see you.

The front of the truck – the engine block of a semi-truck makes for a huge blind spot for vehicles. A truck driver cannot see a vehicle within 20 feet of its front bumper, and even more for compact vehicles.
The back of the truck – due to the length of the trailer on a semi-truck, a truck driver cannot see anyone within 30 feet directly behind them. While there are mirrors in place on the truck, they cannot show everything.
The left side – You may think that just because you are so close to the driver that they can see you, but this is not the case. If you are in the lane immediately to the left of a semi-truck, they are likely unaware of you if you are next to the front half of the truck.
The right side – this side of the vehicle is by far the most dangerous side of the truck. The two lanes to the right of an 18-wheeler are nearly invisible to the driver. Avoid remaining in this area at all costs.

When a driver cannot see you, they may change speeds or lanes and crash into you. Because of how deadly these accidents can be, it is best to avoid these blind spots entirely.
Do not take chances with your health
Remember: if you cannot see a truck driver while driving near them, they cannot see you. Do not risk your safety and the safety of your passengers by assuming you are in a safe spot. If you are driving near a semi-truck, be sure to give them the space they need to drive safely.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Accidents between a passenger vehicle and a commercial truck often result in catastrophic injuries or death for the people in the passenger vehicle. Despite how dangerous these accidents are, trucking accidents are still on the rise.
Many people often associate the increase in accidents as a result of driver error, but the nature of the job may also be partially responsible.
How the job can promote incident
Due to an ever-increasing demand for products and the continued success of online shopping, the demand for product delivery shipments has steadily increased over the years. When drivers struggle to meet their delivery schedules&#8217; demands, they may wind up cutting corners to meet these goals.
Truck drivers may decide to drive extra hours in a day, drive over the speed limit, or take medications or supplements to keep them awake longer. These decisions reduce the truck driver&#8217;s ability to maintain the safety of their vehicle and those around them on the road.
A driver who has spent twenty consecutive hours behind the wheel is less likely to notice passenger vehicles around them before executing a maneuver on the road. This exhaustion can result in a truck pushing another vehicle off the road or rear-ending them.
Do not take chances with your safety
If you are driving near a semi-truck, do not take your safety for granted. Make sure that you are not and one of the trucks blind spots by checking their mirrors. If you cannot see the driver of the vehicle, they cannot see you. Keep an eye on the truck, and if you see any suspicious behavior from the driver or their vehicle, maintain a safe distance between you and them.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Colliding with any fellow motorist on the road can turn a peaceful drive into a nightmare. Getting in a crash with a semi-truck can be especially brutal due to the large size of the vehicle. But if trucks are so big that it’s hard to miss them when they pass by and if the people behind the steering wheel of commercial vehicles are professionals, then how do truck accidents happen?
Just like any accident, one party or both parties involved may be responsible for the collision.
Keeping distance
If the driver of a passenger vehicle contributed to the accident, distractions or driving too close to the truck could be the cause of the crash. Not being aware of one’s surroundings and multitasking behind the wheel can create a terrible outcome. It only takes five seconds to cover the entire length of a football field while driving 55 mph. This means an inattentive drive could pass a handful of trucks and not even realize it and make themselves more prone to crashing with any vehicle they blindly pass.
It’s also worth noting that due to a truck’s large nature, a truck driver’s blind spots are much larger than a passenger vehicle driver. This makes driving side-by-side or directly in front of or behind a truck extremely dangerous. Consequently, switching lanes or merging around or in between trucks can also be a recipe for disaster.
Truck driver mistakes
On the other hand, if a truck driver is at fault, then improper training or fatigue could be contributing factors in an accident. Truck drivers shouldn’t behave like race car drivers and pass and weave around cars as they please. Instead, their training should include lessons on defensive driving tactics that they should apply while on shift. Defensive driving involves perceiving risks and preventing accidents before they happen. This can include only going the speed limit and both slowing down at intersections and when surrounding drivers hit the brakes.
Truck drivers may feel the need to speed if their employer pressures them to make it to their destinations in a specific duration of time. In turn, when speed becomes a priority, safety can fall to the wayside. And another way an employer can set up their truck drivers for failure is by not following federal regulations when it comes to legal shift lengths and breaks. Overworking can cause drowsiness and fatigue and falling asleep at the wheel is a sure way to cause a crash.
Since a truck accident can happen through missteps that truck drivers and passenger vehicle drivers take, it’s important for all motorists to do their part to make Ohio’s roadways safer.The post How do truck accidents happen? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[We’ve all heard about airplane “black boxes.” They contain vital information that can provide explanations for why planes have crashed.
But did you know most semi trucks also have black boxes onboard? A “black box” is also called the Electronic Control Module (ECM). Since the 1990s, most U.S. trucks have been manufactured with ECMs included.
ECMs can record:

Average speed
Highest speed
Time driven
Time spent driving more than 65 miles per hour
Seat belt use
Airbag performance

Originally, ECMs were installed so truck engine manufacturers could determine the validity of truck operator warranty claims. The ECM data can reveal whether bad driving causes engine failures.
Valuable tool for truck accident investigation

ECM data also can be extremely valuable when investigating truck accidents. For example, accident investigators can learn how fast a truck was moving at the time of a crash, plus the RPMs and if or when brakes were applied.
In addition, the ECM information can be compared against driver logs to determine whether the driver was accurately recording the amount of time on the road.
But there are problems with ECMs.
Data can be overwritten or destroyed

ECMs have limited storage capacity. When that space is used up, new data is stored and the oldest data is erased. It’s also possible – and common – for truck operators or trucking companies to erase or damage data after a crash.
As soon as a major truck accident occurs, the trucking company and/or its insurance company’s investigators immediately travel to the accident scene. Sometimes their objective is to get rid of or obscure information that would be damaging in a lawsuit.
That’s why it’s crucial for truck accident victims (or their family members) to contact an experienced truck accident lawyer immediately after a crash. The attorney will begin an investigation. The attorney will promptly file legal documents that demand the preservation of data regarding the truck.
Do you have questions?
If you would like to learn more, contact an attorney who has experience litigating truck accidents.The post Why semi truck “black boxes” are important after an accident first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[People in Ohio and across the U.S. are getting less sleep according to a new study by researchers at Ball State University. What&#8217;s worse is that many professional drivers are among the most sleep deprived. 
Researchers found that the number of Americans getting seven hours of sleep or less per night jumped from 30.9% in 2010 to 35.9% in 2018. However, the numbers are even worse among those working in the transport industry. The study found that the number of transport drivers not getting adequate rest spiked from 32% to 41% over the last decade, which is an increase of 28%. Meanwhile, the study found that 50% of police and military members, 45% of health care support workers and 41% of production workers fail to get enough sleep within each 24-hour period. According to the lead author of the study, the research team couldn&#8217;t identify specific reasons why people are getting less sleep. 
The study also found that the number of men getting seven hours or less of sleep increased from 30.5% in 2010 to around 35.5% in 2018. For women, the numbers jumped from 31.2% in 2011 to 35.8% in 2018. The numbers of white, black, Asian and multiracial adults reporting inadequate sleep also increased over the same period of time. Studies have found that sleep deprivation is linked to a range of physical and mental health issues. It can also increase the risk of injury, reduce productivity and increase the risk of premature death. 
People who are injured in an accident caused by a drowsy truck driver might have a strong personal injury claim. Columbus, Ohio, truck accident injury lawyers may evaluate a victim&#8217;s case and explain the legal remedies available. One possibility might be to file a personal injury claim seeking compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages and more.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When a semi has to make a left turn, there&#8217;s the potential for disaster.
Maybe you&#8217;re in the left-hand turn lane on the road the semi is trying to turn onto. You may have to back up if they don&#8217;t have enough space to complete the turn without hitting your car. If there is nowhere to go, now you either have a crash with the trailer as it swings through your lane, crushing itself into your window, or you have an accident as you back into the car behind you.
Or, maybe you&#8217;re going down the road toward the truck. The driver may turn without enough space, blocking the entire road &#8212; and then some &#8212; and making it impossible for you to avoid an accident. They may even make that turn far more slowly than you thought they would, as they try to be cautious, and you could get hit from behind as you slow down.
The risk
These are just two examples, but they make it clear that left-hand turns are very dangerous, especially for oversized commercial vehicles. In fact, did you know that UPS found them so risky &#8212; and such a waste of time &#8212; that they basically told all of their drivers never to do it?
That&#8217;s right. The UPS truck will turn right multiple times to come around the block without turning left. They seek out these routes.
Some have argued that everyone should do this. Crossing in front of oncoming traffic is one of the single most dangerous things you can do in a car. You have to do it every time you turn left. If you avoided it, you could drastically reduce the odds of an accident.
Commercial pressure
That said, many semitruck drivers still turn left, causing the issues noted above. UPS is just one company; most do not enforce a no-left rule. There is a lot of pressure on commercial drivers to make deliveries quickly and meet deadlines.
Does that pressure lead to unsafe driving? It can. Making lefts is just one example of it. Drivers may also break the speed limit or run red lights. They may drive aggressively and look for shortcuts where their trucks don&#8217;t even fit. The pressure to work quickly can prove very dangerous for the rest of the drivers on the road at the same time as the truck.
Your options after an accident
If you get hit by a semi or a commercial vehicle, whether it is turning left or not, you could suffer serious injuries. Make sure you know what options you have after the wreck.The post Should trucks turn across oncoming traffic? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Truck accidents can be particularly frightening to others on the road in Ohio. While there are a number of factors that can lead to crashes involving large trucks, truck driver fatigue poses a special concern. Long hours over monotonous stretches of highway, especially at night, are part of a truck driver&#8217;s job. Even following federal regulations on hours of service mean that a trucker spends many hours behind the wheel. Those regulations limit truck drivers to 11 hours of driving and a 14-hour total workday. 
In too many circumstances, truck drivers exceed those federal limits, contributing to a dangerous level of drowsiness. In addition, large trucks are massive in size, weight and volume. In any truck collision involving a passenger vehicle, the people in the smaller vehicle are at a much higher risk of severe injuries and even fatalities. Fatigue can be almost as deadly as drunkenness or distraction when it comes to driving, so it is particularly concerning that large truck accidents continue to rise across the country.
Many industries rely on trucking for supplies, commerce and trade; in North Dakota, the oil industry is one such example. As a result, 67% of truck crashes in the state take place in the regions most heavily associated with the industry. Some of these truck accidents even occur on bypasses specifically constructed to enhance roadway safety by limiting the likelihood of a crash involving a semi-truck. In two deadly crashes, an 18-wheeler crossed the center line of the road and slammed head-on into another vehicle.
Truck accidents pose a major risk to others on the roadway, especially when fatigued or otherwise negligent driving is involved. People who have been injured in a trucking crash through no fault of their own may want to contact Columbus, Ohio, truck accident injury lawyers to seek compensation for their damages.The post Trucking crashes pose risk to highway safety first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Truck accidents take many lives and cause millions of dollars in property damage and personal injury each year, and the legal issues at hand are often hard to resolve. Unlike accidents between consumer drivers, truck accidents may be the liability of the driver, the driver&#8217;s employer or some other third party.
Building a strong claim after a truck accident involves gathering as much evidence from the scene of the collision as possible, so that you can identify the party that holds liability and present evidence that backs up this claim. Without strong evidence that clarifies why the accident happened and what party is liable, it is difficult to protect your rights and seek full compensation for your losses.
Is the driver an employee?
One of the first things you need to do as you build your claim is define the relationship between the driver and the party that hired them to drive. If they acted as an independent contractor when the accident occurred, they may hold liability directly. However, if they acted as an employee, then their employee may be liable.
It is also good to know who owns the truck, because the owner of the truck has the legal right to delete electronic control module data until they receive a request to turn it over. You should request this data as soon as you can, to build your claim. Regardless of the driver&#8217;s employee relationship, they can give you their drivers&#8217; logs upon request.
Third party possibilities 
The driver is not always the cause of the accident. If some other vehicle did not cause the accident, a crew may have done a bad job packing the cargo and securing it within the truck, allowing the load to shift while the truck was in motion. In this case, the company employing the crew that secured the cargo may have liability.
It is also possible that a faulty part or a bad repair by a maintenance team caused the accident. Carefully examining all the evidence can help you determine what exactly caused the accident and who should pay for your expenses, losses and suffering.
Your claim may take some time to assemble, and you should not wait to receive medical care and begin rehabilitation. Do not hesitate to use the legal guidance that you need to stay on top of this complex process and ensure that your rights remain secure while you work toward recovery.The post Identifying the liable party after a truck accident first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When an accident involving a large truck occurs in Ohio, the results can be catastrophic. That&#8217;s why safety advocates want to use modern technology to minimize the number of accidents involving big rigs. In particular, forward crash avoidance and mitigation systems have been touted as potential saviors. 
In 2017, more than 4,100 individuals died in accidents involving large trucks. A good portion of these individuals were pedestrians and drivers in passenger cars. While any accident involving a big rig has the potential to be devastating, some of the most serious accidents involve large trucks rear-ending smaller vehicles. 
The number 4,100 becomes more devastating when compared to fatalities in air travel. For this many people to die in aviation, a 737 full of passengers would have to crash twice every month with complete fatalities. 
Many feel that the regulatory institutions that have the responsibility for making the highway safe are not reacting as aggressively as they should. Safety advocates say that implementing forward crash avoidance and mitigation technology could significantly lower the accident rate. Despite these recommendations, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has yet to require large commercial trucks to have these systems.
The family of a victim killed in a truck crash may want to speak to an attorney. A wrongful death attorney could help family members of the deceased by holding the at-fault parties accountable. After reviewing investigations, witness testimony and information gathered by security cameras, the lawyer could bring a wrongful death claim to court. The victim&#8217;s family could ultimately receive compensation covering various damages.
