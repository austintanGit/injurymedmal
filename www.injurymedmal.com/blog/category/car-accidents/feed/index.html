																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite changes to the law and increased public safety initiatives, distracted driving continues to be a problem across America, including right here in Ohio. Distracted driving can take many forms, too, from texting and driving to eating, reading, and conversing while operating a vehicle.
And the effects can be devastating. Taking one’s eyes off the road for even a split second can cause nearly the length of a football field to pass without realizing it, which could cause a driver to fail to stop for slow or halted traffic. It can even cause a motorist to run a red light or a stop sign, or swerve into oncoming traffic.
How common is distracted driving in Ohio?
Sadly, the number of distracted driving accidents in Ohio is significant. In fact, according to statistics, between 2015 and 2020 there were more than 75,000 car accidents attributable to distracted driving. Franklin County alone had more than 7,400 distracted driving wrecks during that time period. Making matters worse is the fact that hundreds of these cases statewide resulted in death, and thousands more were likely injured in these crashes.
Who causes these distracted driving accidents?
Anyone can cause a distracted driving accident, but statistics do show some trends. For example, men are more likely to engage in distracted driving in Ohio than women, although both play a major role in these accidents, with men accounting for 55% of them and women accounting for 44%. Younger drivers also make up more than a third of these wrecks. This could be attributable to their lack of driving experience and skills, or it could be on account of their more extensive use of electronic devices while driving.
What can you do to protect yourself?
When out on the roads, you need to be as defensive as possible. This means keeping an appropriate amount of distance between yourself and other vehicles and remaining attentive to those who are beside and behind you. Follow all traffic laws, but also don’t hesitate to contact law enforcement if you see a driver who is operating his or her vehicle in a distracted or otherwise dangerous fashion. After all, the statistics also show that law enforcement officials are doing their best to issue citations to those who text and drive and drive in other distracted ways.
Taking legal action to protect your interests
If you or a loved one has been injured in one of these wrecks, then you may want to consider legal action. Doing so may be the only way for you to obtain true accountability and recover the compensation that you need and deserve. Pursuing one of these claims isn’t always easy, though, as it can be fraught with legal complexities. That’s why you may want to consider working closely with a legal professional who understands the law and how to apply it to your set of circumstances. An attorney can also help you investigate the accident to not only gain a clear picture of what, exactly, happened, but also to gather the evidence that you need to support your claim.
Remember, the individual who injured you and his or her insurance company isn’t looking out for your best interests. So, even though you may be offered a settlement, you shouldn’t jump on it too quickly. Instead, you should carefully analyze the offer in light of your damages and your likelihood of success should you take your case to trial. If you’d like assistance in conducting that analysis and building the strongest case possible under the circumstances, then now may be the time to discuss your case with an experienced legal professional.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Spring has come to Columbus. With sunny skies and temperatures rising into the 70s, motorcyclists throughout the metro area are prepping their bikes and taking to the streets and highways again. Unfortunately, if spring is the start of motorcycle season in Columbus, it is also the time of year when motorcycle accidents start happening.
Many motorcycle collisions with larger vehicles happen because a car or truck driver was negligent and made a crucial, avoidable mistake. Here are three tips for drivers who do not want to seriously injure a rider.

Do not tailgate motorcycles. Tailgating is never safe, but especially so when it is a motorcycle in front of you. Riders need plenty of space in case they need to make a sudden stop or turn.
Look for multiple bikes. If you see one rider, chances are good there are more close by. Many motorcyclists like to ride in groups. Don&#8217;t assume that just because you are clear of one bike, it is okay to turn or change lanes.
Watch your blind spots. A motorcycle can be even harder to find in your vehicle&#8217;s blind spots than a much larger truck, SUV or car. Use your mirrors to be certain that it is safe before you merge or change lanes.

Finally, here&#8217;s a reminder for people with lawns: don&#8217;t toss your grass clippings onto the road in front of your home. It can cause a motorcycle to lose grip on the road and cause a wreck.
Even experienced riders cannot always avoid getting injured by negligent motorists. When they do, turning to a personal injury attorney for help can make the process of getting fair compensation faster and easier.The post Tips for Columbus drivers to prevent motorcycle accidents first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[The question of how much car insurance to purchase can be a tricky one. You hope that it&#8217;s something you will never need. It can be tempting to play the odds, get the bare minimum, and hope you never cause an accident or are never hurt in an accident due to someone else’s fault. Buying insurance online often results in a search for the lowest premium, which usually results in inadequate insurance limits.
However, motor vehicle accidents are more common than you think. After an accident, the last thing you want is to find yourself underinsured.
Required minimum insurance
Ohio law requires all drivers to carry liability insurance. This insurance is designed to help cover injuries and property damage that you cause to someone else. The minimum amount of coverage you must carry is:

$25,000 for bodily injury to one person
$50,000 for injuries to multiple people
$25,000 for property damage

Dollar for dollar, the minimum amount of coverage is the most expensive automobile insurance you can buy. This is because the value of most car accidents falls within the $25,000 range. Paying for higher policy limits up to $250,000 is less expensive, dollar for dollar, than the bare minimum. If you can afford policy limits higher than the state minimums, you should buy higher limits.
Why you need uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage
If an accident is the other driver’s fault and he or she has no or low liability policy limits, you will likely be undercompensated.
In this scenario, it is good to have additional uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage on your auto policy. It will help cover your expenses if the other driver has no or too little insurance. Such coverage will also cover your pain and suffering and injuries. In many states, including Ohio, you must specifically request uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. You should request as high a limit as possible for such coverage, consistent with what you can afford.
Even if you or the other driver has adequate insurance coverage, you still must prove the value of  your case. A skilled legal professional can help negotiate the settlement you deserve or help explore additional avenues of compensation when necessary.The post How much car insurance should I have? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Drunk driving endangers the lives of both the driver and others on the road. But while most people would not dare get behind the wheel after drinking, an alarming number of them drive under the influence of something even deadlier: the smartphone.
According to a recent report, the number of “phone addicts” on the road doubled between 2018 and 2019. Here is how a phone addict behaves when behind the wheel:

Drives 1.5 times more than the average driver
Spends three times more drive time using their phone than the average driver
Actively ignores the road 28 percent of the time while driving

What’s more concerning is while 85 percent of surveyed phone addicts admit distracted driving is a problem, 90 percent believe they are safe drivers.
How dangerous is distracted driving?
The Centers for Disease Control defines distracted driving as driving while doing another activity that takes your attention from the road. A glance at your phone may seem harmless, but a study from the University of Utah found cell phone drivers were just as bad and sometimes worse than drunk drivers at driving.
Overall, the study found people who use phones while driving:

Are more likely to get into an accident than the average driver
Drive more slowly
Are 9 percent slower to apply the brakes
Are 24 percent more variant in their following distance
Are 19 percent slower to get back to normal speed after braking

Also, while drunk drivers are generally the most active on the road between 12 a.m. and 3 a.m., phone addicts are driving when roads are busy, between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.
The bottom line
Phone addicts today pose a more significant threat to public safety than those who drink and drive. To protect the lives of you and those around you, set the smartphone aside and keep yourself distraction-free.The post Are phone addicts the new drunk drivers? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[A leading manufacturer of child booster seats prioritized sales over safety, according to a report published in ProPublica.
In 2012, a safety engineer at Evenflo recommended the company stop making booster seats for children under 40 pounds, according to ProPublica, which is a nonprofit investigative journalism organization. The engineer’s advice was based on government research. The engineer&#8217;s recommendation would have aligned the company with Canadian regulations and recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
An Evenflo executive rejected the recommendation, according to the ProPublica report. Later that year, the executive again rejected the advice to stop making the Big Kid model booster seat.
ProPublica’s report was based on: Evenflo’s internal side-impact test videos; thousands of pages of sworn depositions and company marketing materials. The information previously had been protected by secrecy orders in lawsuits around the country.
In response to the ProPublica report, Evenflo’s corporate attorney said it produces “safe, effective, affordable products, including the Big Kid” booster seat.
Flunked side-impact tests
Perhaps even more brazen than keeping the booster seats on the market, Evenflo said in its marketing that Big Kid boosters were “Side Impact Tested.” The company did not reveal in its marketing that the booster seat flunked the company’s side-impact tests, the ProPublica report said.
Side-impact collisions are considered more dangerous than head-on collisions. With a side-on collision, the only thing protecting the occupant is a door.
NHTSA did not fulfill its obligations
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also failed to protect children from side-impact crashes. Congress, nearly 20 years ago, passed a law that directed the NHTSA to write rules to improve the safety of car seats and booster seats. NHTSA never wrote standards for side-impact tests.
Families of children injured or killed in accidents have filed lawsuits against Evenflo and its main competitors – Graco and Dorel. When ProPublica asked Dorel and Graco to provide side-impact test results, the companies refused. Dorel told ProPublica it stopped selling boosters for children under 40 pounds in 2016.
Do you have questions?
If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, contact an experienced attorney.The post Manufacturer of child booster seats ignored internal safety recommendations, report says first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to statistics published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the number of car accident fatalities connected to aggressive driving is on a steep rise. The figure spiked almost 500% over the ten years between 2006 and 2015, from 80 fatalities to 467. Drivers in Ohio may already be aware of the increased prevalence of road rage, and there are things they can do to make motor vehicle travel safer.
Drivers can begin by monitoring and minimizing their own levels of stress wherever possible. This might mean getting more sleep or reducing the number of pre-commute morning decisions by, for example, getting meals ready and setting out clothes for work the night before. Being courteous to other drivers can also help reduce the risk of road rage; giving the other driver the right of way can avoid anger issues according to a AAA director of safety advocacy and research.
The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety reported that almost 80% of drivers polled said they&#8217;d expressed serious anger at least once in the previous year. Of the respondents, 51% said they had tailgated another driver on purpose, 47% said they had yelled at other drivers, 45% said they had honked at other cars out of annoyance or anger and 33% said they had made obscene gestures to another driver. Twelve percent admitted to cutting off other drivers on purpose.
Drivers who let their anger or frustration get the best of them on the road can cause serious car accidents, leading to injuries or fatalities. In cases where a person is injured due to the actions of another driver, he or she may have claims for damages to be paid by insurance companies or at-fault parties. Columbus, Ohio, auto accident injuries compensation attorneys may be able to help in such cases by gathering evidence in support of the claims or negotiating with insurers on the client&#8217;s behalf.The post Data shows road rage on the rise first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When there is a fatal accident in Ohio or anywhere across the nation, there could be the foundation to file a legal claim. The circumstances of the incident are key. In many of these cases, the accident occurred while a person was at the accident site as part of their job. In such a situation, the employer could be held liable.
A fatal car crash that killed an employee has sparked a legal filing against the Comedy Central show “Lights Off” starring comedian and actor David Spade. According to the lawsuit filed by the man’s parents, the producers let another man who was working as an accountant on the program drive drunk. The accident happened at approximately 10:30 p.m. on Aug. 1 in Los Angeles. A 2018 Infiniti driven by the man crashed into an Acura. The Acura careened to where the decedent, 24, was standing. He suffered severe head trauma.
The driver was arrested for driving under the influence and other charges. The media company Viacom owns Comedy Central and is also named in the lawsuit. The company and other entities are accused of letting the driver drink to excess at a premiere party for Mr. Spade’s show. The family also says that the company is responsible because it provided a valet parking service, encouraging people to drive to the party. Mr. Spade is not named in the filing.
Losing a loved one in a fatal accident is difficult. When it could have been avoided, it is even worse. Drunk drivers and the possibility that their behavior was enabled might be the basis to file a legal claim for compensation. To determine if there is a viable case and move forward, Columbus, Ohio, wrongful death attorneys might be able to help.The post Fatal DUI car crash after TV show premiere party sparks lawsuit first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many Ohio residents probably own a car with a driver assistance system. The thing to remember is that the technology behind these systems is not perfect. Cameras and sensors may more easily pick up moving vehicles than parked vehicles, for instance. They may set a safe speed for drivers as long as they stay in their lane, but changing lanes may cause a &#8220;cut-out scenario&#8221; that confuses the sensors.
Several crashes have occurred because the cameras and sensors did not &#8220;see&#8221; an obstruction ahead and activate the automatic braking system. In 2016, a Florida man died when his Tesla Model S collided into the side of a big rig. On January 22, 2018, the same vehicle caused a driver in Culver City, California, to crash into the rear of a fire truck. No one was injured or killed.
What happened was that the Tesla Model S sped up when the vehicle in front changed lanes, hitting the fire truck at a speed of 31 mph. It gave a collision warning 0.49 seconds before impact.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is clear about the benefits of automatic emergency braking: It can cut the rate of rear-end crashes by half. But its relationship with the semi-autonomous systems that Tesla is developing remains problematic, so driver involvement is still essential.
If a vehicle malfunction contributes to a crash, the driver may not be entirely to blame for it. In fact, he or she may file a product liability claim against the automaker. Crash victims, regardless of their position, may want to hire Columbus, Ohio, auto accident injuries compensation attorneys before filing their claim. The other side, be it an auto insurance company or an automaker, might oppose the claim, but a lawyer may help negotiate for a fair settlement.The post Tesla’s sensor tech still a work in progress first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Being involved in a car accident as a college student can severely affect your studies, whether you were physically injured or not. It&#8217;s important to recognize the profound ways that the car accident you were involved in affected you, whether it&#8217;s physically, emotionally or financially. This is because it may be possible to gain back damages as a result of going through the settlement process.
Your first step should be to gain a good understanding of where the law stands in the state in which the car accident occurred. In Ohio, drivers are required to carry liability car insurance to cover damages that could occur in an accident. Ohio is an at-fault car insurance state, which means that damages are covered by the insurer of the party that was to blame for the accident. If you believe that you were not to blame for the accident, it is important to hold the other party responsible.
How can I prove fault after a car accident?
An investigation will be made by your insurance company after the car accident, and they will work to establish what led up to the event. If you have any evidence relating to the accident, you should provide this information. You may have seen the other driver using their phone before the collision, for example. This could suggest that they were engaging in distracted driving. This type of eyewitness evidence can be verified through further investigations, for example through tracking their call history.
What damages may I be able to claim?
In theory, you will be entitled to the coverage of all financial expenses as well as damages for the pain and suffering that the accident caused you. You may be interested in whether you can gain compensation for missed classes due to the car accident. While compensation for individual classes is not common, if you had to drop out of college as a result of extensive physical or mental injuries, you may be able to gain back the costs of tuition.
If you have been injured in a car accident as a student in Ohio, you must take action to understand the law and to gain the damages that you deserve.The post Claiming damages after a car accident as a student first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[While drowsy driving poses a danger to people on the road, preventing this behavior is a challenge. There is no test for fatigued driving as there is for drunk driving, and inadequate transportation systems in America sometimes leave people with few other transportation options. Ohio residents might like to know more about the problem of driver fatigue.
One AAA survey questioned participants about how often they had been fatigued while driving within the previous month. Nearly one-third of those questioned had operated a vehicle at least once while struggling to keep their eyes open.
Adults need an average of seven hours of sleep every night. However, even those who get enough sleep may still feel tired. This is often because of prescription medications or health conditions. Drug interactions can cause drowsiness while muscle relaxers, antidepressants, blood pressure drugs and anxiety medications could also make one sleepy. To stay awake while driving, switching off with a partner or just having someone to talk to could help. A break may be needed every few hours, and napping could also be beneficial. However, one should not nap for longer than 20 minutes to avoid grogginess. One tried and true method for staying awake is caffeine. Methods that do not work well for wakefulness include turning the radio up and rolling the windows down or blasting the air conditioner for cold air.
Car collisions can cause catastrophic injuries to occupants of other vehicles that often require extensive and expensive medical treatment. When it can be determined that the crash was caused by the negligence of another motorist, victims might want to have legal assistance when seeking compensation for their losses.The post Why drowsy driving happens, how to stop it first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>
