																<content:encoded><![CDATA[In Ohio, 14% of fatal motor vehicle accidents are caused by speeding. The state actually has the ninth-lowest percentage rate in the nation for fatal accidents caused by speeding. Ohio is far below the District of Columbia and New Hampshire, which have percentage rates of 39.5% and 38%, respectively. However, speeding is still a serious problem in the state.
A study by ValuePenguin looked at data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding fatalities to reach its conclusions. The states with the lowest rates of deadly accidents from speeding were Florida and Mississippi. Most other states in the Southeast were also among those with the lowest rates of speeding-related deaths. Overall, more than 20% of fatal motor vehicle accidents in the country happened because of drivers either traveling faster than the posted speed limit or going too fast for road conditions.
In addition to Washington, D.C., 17 states had a speeding-related motor vehicle fatality rate that was at least 20%. Drivers should be aware that in addition to the danger to themselves and others, speeding can also be expensive. Recognizing the role of speeding in causing serious accidents, insurance companies may significantly raise a person&#8217;s premiums as a result of getting a speeding ticket.
A family that has lost a loved one as a result of another driver&#8217;s speeding or some other reckless action may want to consult with an auto accident attorney. Legal counsel could investigate the cause of an accident and determine if a wrongful death suit would be appropriate. Depending on the circumstances, plaintiffs could obtain compensation for funeral costs, medical bills, loss of consortium and more.The post Study looks at deadly accidents caused by speeding first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[There were more than 200,000 injuries caused by drunk drivers in Ohio and throughout the country in 2017. According to the president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), it is imperative that the automotive industry do whatever it can to make sure that drunk drivers cannot operate motor vehicles. A combination of state and federal funds is currently helping to spur the development of the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety.
It can detect alcohol in a person&#8217;s breath and won&#8217;t allow the car to start if an individual has a blood alcohol content of .08% or higher. A touch-based system could be available at a later date according to an individual who is helping to run the program. The breath-based system is currently being tested and could be available for wider release at some point in 2020.
In addition to government research programs, Volvo has said that it wants to install sensors and cameras in its vehicles to prevent drunk driving. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said that a system to stop drunk drivers from starting their vehicles could save up to 7,000 lives per year. The NHTSA says that drunk drives accounted for 29% of traffic fatalities in 2017, so keeping drunk drivers off of the road could make highways significantly safer.
Individuals who have been in a motor vehicle accident may consider hiring Columbus, Ohio, fatal motor vehicle accident legal representation. Doing so may help to preserve their rights and make it easier to obtain compensation for medical bills and other costs related to the accident. These costs might include lost wages, lost future earnings and money spent replacing property lost or damaged in a crash. An injured victim may choose to settle a case without taking it to trial.The post How research can prevent drunk driving first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Drivers who cause fatal two-vehicle accidents in Ohio and around the country are nearly twice as likely to have opioids in their system as drivers who are not at fault.. A study that came to this conclusion was published in JAMA Network Open in February. 
According to the study, lane departure is the leading cause of fatal crashes of all types. In order to determine what role opioids play in such crashes, researchers analyzed data from 18,321 deadly two-vehicle accidents listed in the federal Fatality Analysis Reporting System. Of those crashes, they found that 7,535 were attributed to a driver&#8217;s failure to stay in the proper lane. Of the drivers who were found at-fault for those crashes, 918 tested positive for prescription painkillers. In comparison, only 549 of the drivers who were not found at-fault tested positive for opioids. 
Hydrocodone was the most common opioid found in drivers&#8217; systems, with 32 percent of drivers testing positive for the drug. Morphine was second, with 27 percent testing positive, and oxycodone was third, with 19 percent testing positive. The authors of the study said the findings only show an association between opioids and fatal crashes, not causation. They also said that the study does not indicate that drivers taking painkillers for chronic health conditions are causing more car accidents. However, people who are not used to taking opioids could be at elevated risk for causing a crash. 
Families who have lost loved ones in a drug-related car accident might benefit from Columbus, Ohio, fatal motor vehicle accident legal representation. A legal professional could evaluate the family&#8217;s case and help negotiate a settlement for funeral and burial expenses and other related losses.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the early morning hours of March 17, 2018, a former Ohio State University student was killed in a two-car accident at approximately 2:15 a.m. The accident occurred in Columbus, Ohio, at the intersection of Summit Street and East 15th Avenue.
The victim was a 23-year-old man originally from Dublin, Ohio. According to school records, the victim was enrolled at Ohio State University in the fall of 2017. The victim was traveling southbound on Summit Street when he collided with another vehicle. The second vehicle, which was driving east from 15th Avenue, had pulled onto Summit Street at the same time the victim reached the intersection. The Columbus Division of Police said that the victim was declared dead at the scene.
The other driver and his passenger only suffered superficial wounds and were able to leave the scene on their own accord after being treated for minor injuries at the scene. A passenger of the victim was also unharmed. Police have yet to publicly announce a cause for the collision, but they maintain the investigation is still ongoing.
When the unthinkable happens, and a loved one is killed in an accident, the surviving family members may be able to file a claim for wrongful death. The cost of the victim&#8217;s medical bills, funeral and future lost wages can be daunting. Columbus, Ohio, fatal motor vehicle accident legal representation may be able to help individuals who have lost loved ones pursue a claim for damages against the party responsible for the accident. An attorney may be able to negotiate a settlement with the responsible party or his or her insurance company. In cases where a settlement is not possible, a lawyer may file a lawsuit, draft pre-trial motions and try the case in front of a jury in order to obtain damages through the legal system.
