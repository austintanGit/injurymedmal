																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we head off to our morning commute, to run errands or to drop our kids off at soccer practice, we generally do not expect that we could be struck by a car. Unfortunately, incidents such as this happen every day in Ohio. Most Ohioans carry auto insurance policies that will compensate them financially should they be involved in a car crash, and in fact Ohio law requires motorists to have a certain amount of auto insurance coverage. However, how much coverage do you really need?
Minimum coverage
In Ohio, the minimum car insurance coverage is generally the most expensive. Under Ohio law, motorists must carry at least $25,000 in insurance coverage for injury/death of one person, $50,000 for injury/death of two or more individuals and $25,000 for property damage in the event of a crash. Carrying the minimum amount of insurance can be costly for motorists and may discourage them from carrying more than the minimal coverage. However, carrying further protection may not be as costly as carrying the minimal protection.
Carrying further coverage
While the minimum amount of insurance coverage can be costly, carrying a further $250,000 in insurance coverage may wind up being less costly in the end. If you are in an motor vehicle accident that results in injuries or significant property damage, the costs could go above and beyond the minimum insurance requirements and you could face a lawsuit for the costs that are left. If you carry enough insurance coverage you may avoid the possibility of a lawsuit that could cause you to incur a significant amount of expenses. The extra coverage you may want to consider includes uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, medical payments and collision and comprehensive coverage.
Learn more about your options if you are in a car crash
Whether you carry the minimum amount of insurance coverage or a greater amount of insurance coverage, if you are involved in a serious car crash you may find that your damages exceed what is covered by your insurance. If this is the case, you may want to consider filing a lawsuit against the party responsible for the crash. This post is for educational purposes only and does not contain legal advice. Our firm’s webpage on auto accident injuries may be a good resource for those who have been in a car crash and are looking for further information on their rights and options.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[The question of how much car insurance to purchase can be a tricky one. You hope that it&#8217;s something you will never need. It can be tempting to play the odds, get the bare minimum, and hope you never cause an accident or are never hurt in an accident due to someone else’s fault. Buying insurance online often results in a search for the lowest premium, which usually results in inadequate insurance limits.
However, motor vehicle accidents are more common than you think. After an accident, the last thing you want is to find yourself underinsured.
Required minimum insurance
Ohio law requires all drivers to carry liability insurance. This insurance is designed to help cover injuries and property damage that you cause to someone else. The minimum amount of coverage you must carry is:

$25,000 for bodily injury to one person
$50,000 for injuries to multiple people
$25,000 for property damage

Dollar for dollar, the minimum amount of coverage is the most expensive automobile insurance you can buy. This is because the value of most car accidents falls within the $25,000 range. Paying for higher policy limits up to $250,000 is less expensive, dollar for dollar, than the bare minimum. If you can afford policy limits higher than the state minimums, you should buy higher limits.
Why you need uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage
If an accident is the other driver’s fault and he or she has no or low liability policy limits, you will likely be undercompensated.
In this scenario, it is good to have additional uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage on your auto policy. It will help cover your expenses if the other driver has no or too little insurance. Such coverage will also cover your pain and suffering and injuries. In many states, including Ohio, you must specifically request uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. You should request as high a limit as possible for such coverage, consistent with what you can afford.
Even if you or the other driver has adequate insurance coverage, you still must prove the value of  your case. A skilled legal professional can help negotiate the settlement you deserve or help explore additional avenues of compensation when necessary.The post How much car insurance should I have? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist coverage, also known as UM/UIM is some of the least expensive insurance you can buy, but it is one of the most important parts of your automobile insurance coverage. UM/UIM covers you and your family when they are injured in a car accident by another driver who is uninsured, or who doesn&#8217;t have enough coverage to pay for the extent of the injuries they have caused. All Ohioans are required to carry automobile insurance, but many simply don&#8217;t.&nbsp; An even higher number of Ohio drivers&nbsp;simply purchase the state minimum which will not begin to cover the medical costs of injuries you receive in an accident, or the long term ramifications on your life.
What happens when you are injured by a hit and run driver and the police are unable to identify the person who caused your injuries? What happens when a person has the state minimum insurance coverage and your medical bills are more than the level of their coverage?
You are left to pay the difference. That stark reality is a hard fact that many injured victims must face each year. As experienced accident and injury attorneys who have served Columbus and Central Ohio for decades, we can tell you this happens more often than it should. The first place we will turn when our client&#8217;s injuries and costs exceed the coverage of the negligent party is their own UM/UIM coverage. That&#8217;s why it is there, and yet insurance companies can make it quite difficult to collect on your own policy.
We handle all of the legal issues necessary with all parties involved to ensure that our clients are justly compensated for what has happened. We strongly recommend that you call your insurance company or representative and raise your UM/UIM coverage to the maximum level possible under your policy. This extra $30 to $50 a year will save you tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road, and make it possible for you to fully recover from an unforeseen accident.The post All Columbus and Central Ohio Residents Should Maximize the Amount of Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage in their Automobile Coverage first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>
