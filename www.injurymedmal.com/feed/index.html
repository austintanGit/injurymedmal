																<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the weather heats up, roads in Ohio and throughout the Midwest will soon become crowded with heavy machines. From construction vehicles moving to and from large projects to 18-wheelers delivering products and materials across the country, roads connecting communities, cities and states will be busy. Unfortunately, numerous factors can contribute to an unsafe driving environment.
Even though they are professional drivers, truckers are not immune to making mistakes while behind the wheel. Unfortunately, they are prone to fatigue due to long hours, a tight schedule and the monotony of hundreds of miles of road each day. When fatigue or drowsiness overcomes a truck driver, motorists in smaller passenger vehicles are at risk for catastrophic injuries.
Numerous factors can cause truck driver fatigue, including:

Schedule pressure: Truck drivers are under immense pressure to make deliveries quickly and safely. While numerous restrictions are in place to guarantee a driver takes the mandated rest breaks, some truckers will still push themselves to the limits of exhaustion to stay productive. Unfortunately, this results in unsafe driving habits and dangerous roadways.
Impaired driving: Whether it is a long haul across thousands of miles or the final delivery of a double shift, drivers often rely on illegal substances to either improve their mood or help them pass the time. Unfortunately, numerous substances can impair cognitive ability, dull perceptions and slow reaction times.
Powerful medication: It is not uncommon for individuals to rely on prescription or over-the-counter medication to alleviate symptoms such as those that accompany a cold, stomach flu or seasonal allergies. Unfortunately, these medications can make a trucker drowsy, dizzy and unsafe.

Whether it is a city street, county road or highway, drivers must always be on the lookout for dangerous drivers. While many people stereotype a dangerous driver as someone who is speeding or driving recklessly, numerous factors lead to danger. If the truck driver is distracted, impaired or fatigued, can a devastating collision be far behind?The post Are you sharing the road with drowsy truckers? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious injury that comes about if an unexpected physical shock does damage to the person’s brain. A TBI can cause serious, long-lasting damage to a person’s brain (which can result in disability) or it can cause death. TBI is an umbrella term and many other, more specific injuries fall under that category. Because the brain is such a complex organ, the destruction can be confined to one area of the brain or it can be more widespread. Also, the damage to the brain can be mild (a mild concussion) or it can result in severe injury, coma, or death.
Different kinds of TBIs
There are a few different types of brain injuries that are seen in individuals.

Penetrating brain injury: This is an injury in which the skull is open. This occurs if some sort of object has actually entered the skull and has created an opening.
Closed brain injury: This type of injury occurs when something hits the head but does not break the skull. It commonly occurs if the head has been jolted backward and forward and moves the brain and it then becomes bruised, potentially tears the brain tissue, and can disrupt the blood vessels in the brain. This type of brain injury is often caused by the person falling, a motor-vehicle accident, and from sports.
Primary and secondary brain injury: A primary injury is a serious injury to the brain that is a complete injury upon impact. A typical example of a primary brain injury is the result of a car accident, a fall, or a wound from a gunshot. A secondary brain injury is when the results of the injury develop over time and the worst outcome is not seen initially. With a secondary injury, the cells, chemistry, tissues, and or blood vessels are altered, which can lead to significant damage to the brain.
Diffuse axonal injury: This is a tearing of the brain’s nerve fibers, which can occur to the brain upon impact if the brain shifts and turns in the skull. This type of injury commonly causes a coma and injuries to various parts of the brain to occur. The developments that occur in the brain as a result of an accident are often too small to see with the naked eye and may possibly not be seen on a scan.

The causes of a head injury, bruising and brain damage
There are many different possible causes of a head injury in both adults and children. Motor vehicle accidents often cause head injuries. Head injuries may also occur when people fall or they are physically abused in any number of ways.
If someone receives a direct hit to their head, the brain may be physically damaged. One possible bruise to the brain will appear directly where the impact occurred. The brain will move backward because of the impact of the hit and it will run into the skull. This can also cause the brain’s lining, blood vessels, and tissues to cause bruising, bleeding and swelling. If a person does have brain damage as a result of some impact, their symptoms may be mild or they may be more severe. There are some people who suffer permanent damage as the result of a severe injury, which will affect their life in different ways.
Valuable legal advice from a Columbus lawyer
If you have suffered a TBI as a result of another person’s negligence, you may wish to consult with a Columbus, Ohio, lawyer, who can give you the benefit of their knowledge and expertise. The lawyer can ensure that your rights are protected and that you hopefully can receive the compensation that you need and to which you are entitled.The post Exactly what is traumatic brain injury and how long does it last? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Medical facilities and health care professionals pride themselves on diagnosing conditions and treating injuries. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for doctors and nurses to adopt a singular focus in terms of an illness and miss the onset of dangerous conditions. This level of negligence or inattention can lead to serious health complications.
A patient who remains in the same position for extended periods of time can develop the progressive skin condition known as bed sores. While many people equate the onset of bedsores with nursing home residents who are confined to a wheelchair or bed, these pressure sores can develop on the skin under numerous conditions. A medical staff must ensure not only the proper hydration of patients but that they are continuously moved to reduce or eliminate the pressure on certain body parts.
What are bed sores?
Bed sores, also called decubitus ulcers, develop after prolonged periods of pressure against the skin. These sores often affect areas of the body that have little muscle or tissue separating the skin from the bones such as the heels, hips, shoulder blades or tailbone. Without the proper care and attention, the condition can quickly progress through numerous stages of severity including skin damage, tenderness, cellulitis, bone infections and sepsis. An infection can quickly spread through the blood to numerous vital organs leading to severe complications.
After a serious surgery or a medical condition that challenges mobility, a hospital patient faces the risk of developing bedsores. Even with doctors, nurses and techs coming in and out of the hospital room, patients must receive the proper care necessary to prevent this devastating condition.
Far from an isolated complication, bed sores can impact thousands of hospital patients each year. What might seem at first like a minor skin condition can quickly progress to damage muscles and bones – often requiring amputation.The post Can you develop bed sores during a hospital stay? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite changes to the law and increased public safety initiatives, distracted driving continues to be a problem across America, including right here in Ohio. Distracted driving can take many forms, too, from texting and driving to eating, reading, and conversing while operating a vehicle.
And the effects can be devastating. Taking one’s eyes off the road for even a split second can cause nearly the length of a football field to pass without realizing it, which could cause a driver to fail to stop for slow or halted traffic. It can even cause a motorist to run a red light or a stop sign, or swerve into oncoming traffic.
How common is distracted driving in Ohio?
Sadly, the number of distracted driving accidents in Ohio is significant. In fact, according to statistics, between 2015 and 2020 there were more than 75,000 car accidents attributable to distracted driving. Franklin County alone had more than 7,400 distracted driving wrecks during that time period. Making matters worse is the fact that hundreds of these cases statewide resulted in death, and thousands more were likely injured in these crashes.
Who causes these distracted driving accidents?
Anyone can cause a distracted driving accident, but statistics do show some trends. For example, men are more likely to engage in distracted driving in Ohio than women, although both play a major role in these accidents, with men accounting for 55% of them and women accounting for 44%. Younger drivers also make up more than a third of these wrecks. This could be attributable to their lack of driving experience and skills, or it could be on account of their more extensive use of electronic devices while driving.
What can you do to protect yourself?
When out on the roads, you need to be as defensive as possible. This means keeping an appropriate amount of distance between yourself and other vehicles and remaining attentive to those who are beside and behind you. Follow all traffic laws, but also don’t hesitate to contact law enforcement if you see a driver who is operating his or her vehicle in a distracted or otherwise dangerous fashion. After all, the statistics also show that law enforcement officials are doing their best to issue citations to those who text and drive and drive in other distracted ways.
Taking legal action to protect your interests
If you or a loved one has been injured in one of these wrecks, then you may want to consider legal action. Doing so may be the only way for you to obtain true accountability and recover the compensation that you need and deserve. Pursuing one of these claims isn’t always easy, though, as it can be fraught with legal complexities. That’s why you may want to consider working closely with a legal professional who understands the law and how to apply it to your set of circumstances. An attorney can also help you investigate the accident to not only gain a clear picture of what, exactly, happened, but also to gather the evidence that you need to support your claim.
Remember, the individual who injured you and his or her insurance company isn’t looking out for your best interests. So, even though you may be offered a settlement, you shouldn’t jump on it too quickly. Instead, you should carefully analyze the offer in light of your damages and your likelihood of success should you take your case to trial. If you’d like assistance in conducting that analysis and building the strongest case possible under the circumstances, then now may be the time to discuss your case with an experienced legal professional.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every year, more than 10,000 individuals are killed in drunk driving accidents. That equates to 28 drunk driving-related deaths every day, which is one death every 52 minutes. The most recent statistics that are available show that Ohio had more than 1,000 drunk driving deaths in a calendar year, which means that there are thousands of families in our state each year who are heartbroken to hear that their loved one was taken from them too soon. Sadly, these numbers have remained relatively consistent over the years despite increased efforts by law enforcement and public awareness initiatives.
While many of the individuals who are responsible for causing these deaths are held criminally liable for their actions, the truth of the matter is that a criminal prosecution does nothing to help families coping with the financial realities that their loss has caused. For these families, merely getting by on a day-to-day basis can be difficult, especially if their loved one was the primary wage earner in the family. While these lost wages can certainly take a toll, so, too, can medical and funeral expenses, not to mention the emotional pain and suffering that befalls these families.
So, what can these families do to find their own sense of accountability and recover the compensation that they’re owed? One option is to pursue a wrongful death lawsuit. Although it might seem easy to pursue one of these cases in the aftermath of a drunk driving accident, they can actually be rather complicated. That’s why if you’ve lost a loved one to one of these tragic wrecks, then you may want to consider taking the following steps to help build your case.

Gather law enforcement observations: In a lot of drunk driving cases, you can turn to law enforcement to help you prove that the other driver was intoxicated at the time of the accident. This is because police officers may have observations, such as smelling alcohol on the driver’s breath shortly after the accident or seeing the driver throw alcohol containers out of the window prior to the accident. Law enforcement may even have seen the drunk driver try to switch seats with a passenger following an accident. As you’re gathering these observations, be sure to obtain any photographs that law enforcement took during the course of their investigation.
Listen to emergency phone call records: A 9-1-1 call may help establish how the driver was operating his or her vehicle at the time of the accident, as well as help you identify witnesses who were concerned about the driver’s actions both before and after the accident.
Collect criminal records: By digging into a driver’s criminal history, you may find a history of drunk driving that helps support your claim. If that driver does have a history of drunk driving, then there’s a decent chance that he or she was driving on a suspended or revoked license, which makes it even easier to show that he or she was driving negligently.
Gather evidence of damages suffered: This might sound simple enough considering that you can just submit any bills you received from your loved one’s medical providers and the funeral services provider, but there’s a lot more to your wrongful death claim than that. You’ll also want to think about how to portray the ways in which your lost loved one supported your family, including nurturing and guiding his or her children. You can also consider how to illustrate the pain and suffering that your loved one must have been subjected to prior to passing away.

Be diligent to build the strong wrongful death claim that you need
If you’ve lost a loved one to a drunk driving accident, then you’re going through what could be the toughest part of your life. Your emotional pain and suffering can be exacerbated by the financial turmoil that has been thrust upon you, which can leave you stressed about your uncertain future. But you shouldn’t despair. Instead, you should seek out the guidance and support that you need to build a thorough and compelling wrongful death claim. Only then can you rest assured that you’ve positioned yourself as best as possible for success and closing this painful chapter of your life.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we have a medical emergency in our life, we trust in medical professionals to apply their experience, education and sound judgment towards helping us to overcome the adverse effects of our condition. This is especially true in the emergency room, where time is often of the essence for treating dangerous injuries.
Sometimes, unfortunately, doctors and other emergency room personnel make mistakes that can have horrific consequences for the injured person – such as when they discharge someone too early without performing an adequate examination. When can a hospital or doctor be legally accountable for increased injuries that result from a premature emergency room discharge?
What constitutes medical malpractice?
Doctors and other medical professionals have a minimum standard of care that they must always comply with when assisting patients. Medical malpractice is when a doctor negligently deviates from this standard of care, resulting in harm to a patient that could have been avoided if the doctor had behaved as they should have.
When courts must decide whether a particular doctor’s conduct constitutes malpractice, they compare that doctor’s actions with the actions of a hypothetical average and reasonable doctor in their field. If the average doctor would have done something (or refrained from doing something) in a particular situation, then it could be malpractice to deviate from that course of action, especially if doing so harms the patient.
When is premature emergency room discharge malpractice?
Applying this standard to the context of emergency room visits, it could be malpractice for an E.R. doctor to discharge someone before the average doctor would agree that it is safe to do so.
For example, you might be showing signs of a severe bacterial infection, internal bleeding or some other problem that practically any other doctor would recognize, but your E.R. staff failed to catch it and sent you home prematurely, which caused your condition to become much worse.
It’s important to note, however, that just because you suffer from an adverse effect from premature discharge from the E.R. does not necessarily mean that there was medical malpractice involved. The doctor’s decision to discharge you must have been the actual cause of your injury getting worse.
Medical malpractice comes in many forms, and it can cause a great deal of unnecessary suffering. Fortunately, our justice system offers recourses to victims of the negligence of medical personnel.The post Can premature discharge from an emergency room be medical malpractice? first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whether you ride to work, for fun, to reduce your carbon footprint or for exercise, bicycling can be a great alternative to driving in Columbus. Despite its health and environmental benefits, bicycling presents dangers especially when bikers and motorists have to share the road together. What rules should bicyclists and motorists follow so that everyone can reach their destination safely?
Rules for bicyclists on the road
One big rule for bicyclists is to be predictable. This means traveling in the same direction as traffic and riding in bike lanes if there are bike lanes present. Biking on the sidewalk can make it harder for motorists to see you, and sometimes sidewalks end abruptly forcing the bicyclist to ride into traffic. Bicyclists should also signal before turning, and they should look behind them briefly before changing lanes or executing a turn. Bicyclists may want to consider taking a safe riding class. And bicyclists should always make sure to wear a helmet when riding.
Rules for motorists sharing the road with bicyclists
Motorists also have rules to follow when sharing the road with bicyclists. Motorists must yield to a bicyclist’s right of way when necessary to avoid turning in front of the bicyclist and causing an accident. Motorists should make sure they pay attention when reversing, especially in parking lots as there may be bicyclists behind them. At intersections motorists should come to a complete stop and look both ways for any bicyclists approaching them. Motorists should avoid speeding and drive defensively.
Take action if you are involved in a bicycle accident
If you are struck by a car while riding your bicycle you could be seriously injured. When this happens, you may want to learn more about negligence lawsuits. Simply put, motorists have a duty to drive with due care. If they breach this duty by striking a bicyclist, causing injuries that would not have happened but for the crash, the injured bicyclist may be able to hold the negligent motorist accountable.The post How to share the road safely with bicyclists first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Few bonds of trust are stronger than what patients have with their doctors. Suffering illness or injury creates uncertainty and stress during perilous times. Going to a medical professional should represent the first step in clarifying specific problems, if not recovery.
The Indian Health Service (IHS) is an agency serving as the primary federal health care provider and advocate for American Indians and Alaska natives. The group’s mission is to provide medical services to all 2.6 million members of 563 federal recognized tribes throughout 36 states, including Ohio. Their mission is simple: to offer the best care possible.
The Growing Problem of Substandard Native American Health Care
Recent news seems to undermine that mission. According to a Wall Street Journal investigation, IHS has become well known for giving “second chances” to doctors with troubling histories of malpractice allegations that resulted in permanent suspensions and potentially career-ending regulatory sanctions.
After five malpractice settlements, one doctor hired by IHS had previously received a permanent suspension from the facility where he practiced most of his career. The ban was based on findings of “multiple serious deficits in judgment.”
By turning to the IHS, he was able to resume his career. Following five additional malpractice settlements totaling $1.8 million, including two fatalities, the doctor retired.
That quintet of complaints only scratches the surface of the 163 malpractice claims examined, with 40 percent resulting in death. Of the doctors hired by IHS, 25 percent of those recruited should have sounded some type of alert after reviewing their respective applications.
To put this calamity into perspective, insurance actuaries determined that doctors in the United States will have one malpractice claim every 20 years. Surgeons would likely have two during the same period.
IHS saw merit in some physicians who had 10 in the last decade.
Admittedly, recruitment is a challenge for any medical facility. In May of last year, the IHS had a vacancy rate of just under 30 percent. Remote locations and lower pay present hiring. However, lowering standards and failing to secure all information in background checks have a more cataclysmic effect on the health of Native American communities throughout the country.The post Second Chances Undermining Medical Services first appeared on Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble & Dougherty, LLC.]]></content:encoded>

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we head off to our morning commute, to run errands or to drop our kids off at soccer practice, we generally do not expect that we could be struck by a car. Unfortunately, incidents such as this happen every day in Ohio. Most Ohioans carry auto insurance policies that will compensate them financially should they be involved in a car crash, and in fact Ohio law requires motorists to have a certain amount of auto insurance coverage. However, how much coverage do you really need?
Minimum coverage
In Ohio, the minimum car insurance coverage is generally the most expensive. Under Ohio law, motorists must carry at least $25,000 in insurance coverage for injury/death of one person, $50,000 for injury/death of two or more individuals and $25,000 for property damage in the event of a crash. Carrying the minimum amount of insurance can be costly for motorists and may discourage them from carrying more than the minimal coverage. However, carrying further protection may not be as costly as carrying the minimal protection.
Carrying further coverage
While the minimum amount of insurance coverage can be costly, carrying a further $250,000 in insurance coverage may wind up being less costly in the end. If you are in an motor vehicle accident that results in injuries or significant property damage, the costs could go above and beyond the minimum insurance requirements and you could face a lawsuit for the costs that are left. If you carry enough insurance coverage you may avoid the possibility of a lawsuit that could cause you to incur a significant amount of expenses. The extra coverage you may want to consider includes uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, medical payments and collision and comprehensive coverage.
Learn more about your options if you are in a car crash
Whether you carry the minimum amount of insurance coverage or a greater amount of insurance coverage, if you are involved in a serious car crash you may find that your damages exceed what is covered by your insurance. If this is the case, you may want to consider filing a lawsuit against the party responsible for the crash. This post is for educational purposes only and does not contain legal advice.

																<content:encoded><![CDATA[Staying safe while on the road is a constant challenge for drivers. Driving near large trucks, however, seems to be a more significant challenge than many people expect. In fact, one out of every eight deaths in car accidents involves a large truck. While you can usually always see these chipping vehicles on the road, they may not always see you. How can you be sure that you are in a safe space around them?
Know the blind spots
A bigger vehicle means that everything that comes with it is bigger, including the blind spots. For semi-trucks, their blind spots can obscure multiple vehicles at the same time. There are four primary zones that you should always avoid to ensure the truck driver can see you.

The front of the truck – the engine block of a semi-truck makes for a huge blind spot for vehicles. A truck driver cannot see a vehicle within 20 feet of its front bumper, and even more for compact vehicles.
The back of the truck – due to the length of the trailer on a semi-truck, a truck driver cannot see anyone within 30 feet directly behind them. While there are mirrors in place on the truck, they cannot show everything.
The left side – You may think that just because you are so close to the driver that they can see you, but this is not the case. If you are in the lane immediately to the left of a semi-truck, they are likely unaware of you if you are next to the front half of the truck.
The right side – this side of the vehicle is by far the most dangerous side of the truck. The two lanes to the right of an 18-wheeler are nearly invisible to the driver. Avoid remaining in this area at all costs.

When a driver cannot see you, they may change speeds or lanes and crash into you. Because of how deadly these accidents can be, it is best to avoid these blind spots entirely.
Do not take chances with your health
Remember: if you cannot see a truck driver while driving near them, they cannot see you. Do not risk your safety and the safety of your passengers by assuming you are in a safe spot. If you are driving near a semi-truck, be sure to give them the space they need to drive safely.
